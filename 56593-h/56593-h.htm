<p>"We live," wrote Stevenson to
Will H. Low in 1884, "in
a rum age of music without
airs, stories without
incident, pictures without
beauty, American wood-engravings that should
have been etchings, and dry-point etchings
that ought to have been mezzo-tints....
So long as an artist is on his head, is painting
with a flute, or writes with an etcher's
needle, or conducts the orchestra with a meat-axe,
all is well; and plaudits shower along
with roses. But any plain man who tries to
follow the obtrusive canons of his art, is but
a commonplace figure.... He will have his
reward, but he will never be thought a person
of parts."</p>

<p>What would Stevenson say, I wonder, could
he witness the condition to which this confusion
of aims, rapidly spreading since he
wrote, has now reduced all the arts, and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
especially music? "Painting with a flute"
hardly sounds fantastic any longer, now that
symphonies have given place to symphonic
"poems," orchestral "sketches," and tone
"pictures," and program music has taken the
place of supremacy in the art of tones that
magazine illustration occupies among graphic
arts. Anyone who tries nowadays to write
mere music&mdash;expressive of emotion through
beauty&mdash;is more than ever "a commonplace
person." The "persons of parts" are those
who give it the quaint local color of folk-songs,
like Mr. Percy Grainger; or who make of it
an agreeable accessory of dance or stage picture,
like Ravel and Strawinsky, or of colored
lights and perfumes, like Scriabine; or who
spin it into mathematical formulæ as a spider
spins web, like Reger; or who use it as a vehicle
for <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">a priori</i> intellectual theories, like Schoenberg,
or as noise for a nerve stimulant, like
Mr. Leo Ornstein.</p>

<p>The reader will look in vain for these names,
in recent years on everyone's lips, in the table
of contents of this book on "Contemporary
Composers." In the work of most of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
there is, indeed, much of charm or interest,
of vividness, perhaps of permanent power.
But the time when critical appraisal of them
can be anything like final has not yet arrived;
and meanwhile there is in their centrifugal
tendencies, I believe, a real menace to the
best interests of music. One and all, they
look away from that inner emotion "to which
alone," as Wagner said, "can music give a
voice, and music only." They all represent
in one way or another that trivializing of the
great art, that degradation of it to sensationalism,
luxury, or mere illustration, some of
the historic causes of which I have tried to
suggest in the introduction. No sincere lover
of music can regard with anything but the
gravest apprehensions such tendencies toward
decadence.</p>

<p>Fortunately these are, however, powerfully
counteracted, even now, by more constructive
forces, carrying forward the evolution of music
in and for itself which was the main concern
of the great elder masters who regarded it as
a supreme emotional language&mdash;Bach, Beethoven,
Brahms, Wagner, Franck. It is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
representatives of this sounder tradition (despite
the programmism of Strauss and the
sybaritism of Debussy) that I have selected
for discussion here. They have also the further
advantage of having been long enough before
the public to have vindicated already their
claims to permanent place in musical history.</p>

<p>The present volume, it may be added, completes
the series of studies of great creative
musicians from Palestrina to the present day
begun in "Beethoven and His Forerunners,"
"The Romantic Composers," and "From Grieg
to Brahms." For permission to reprint the

<h2>I<br />
<br />
<small>INTRODUCTION<br />
DEMOCRACY AND MUSIC</small></h2>


<p>Lovers and critics of modern
music who are at the same time
interested students of the social
changes which have preceded
and accompanied its growth
must often ask themselves whether there is
any deep connection of cause and effect between
the two sets of phenomena, or whether they
merely happened to take place at the same
time. Have the important social transformations
of the nineteenth century reached so far
in their influence as to the music of our time?
Has sociology any light to throw upon musical
art? The question raises a problem as difficult
as it is fascinating; and the suggestions
which follow are to be taken as guesses and
hints, intended to provoke fertile thought,
rather than as constituting in any sense a
finished theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The change in the nature of the musical
public that has taken place during the nineteenth
century has been gradual but far-reaching.
The essence of it is expressed by
saying that at the end of the eighteenth century
music was in the hands of the nobility
and gentry, and that at the beginning of the
twentieth it is in those of all the people. Under
feudal conditions it was organized by the
patronage system according to the tastes of
the aristocratic few. The thirty most fruitful
years of Haydn's life were spent in the employ
of Prince Esterhazy; Mozart, a skilled pianist
as well as composer, was less dependent on his
patron, but his life was probably shortened by
the hardships he had to face after he had
broken with him; Beethoven, staunch democrat
though he was, realized what he owed his
four patrons, Archduke Rudolph, and Princes
Lobkowitz, Kinsky, and Lichnowsky, and
wrote, after the death of some of them had
reduced the value of his annuity: "In order
to gain time for a great composition, I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
always previously scrawl away a good deal for
the sake of money.... If my salary were
not so far reduced as not to be a salary at all,
I should write nothing but symphonies ...
and church music, or at most quartets." No
doubt the patronage system had its faults and
abuses, which have been quite adequately discussed
by critics; the fact remains that under
it was done the supreme creative work of the
golden age of music. Greater than any of its
material advantages was the spiritual homogeneity
of the group who practised it. By
excluding the lower classes, however unjustly,
they achieved, though artificially, a unity of
feeling that could not then have been achieved
otherwise; and as art is in essence an emotional
reaction this unity of feeling provided a soil in
which its seeds could grow.</p>

<p>But with the French Revolution and the
passing of feudalism this old order perished.
The proclamation of liberty, equality, and fraternity,
paving the way for individualistic competition,
introduced the epoch of industrialism
and capitalism, in which art, like everything
else, was taken out of the hands of a privileged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
class, and made theoretically accessible to all.
As the appreciation of art requires, however,
mental and emotional experience, discipline,
and refining, a process which takes time, what
actually happened was that those gradually emerging
from poverty through industrialism&mdash;the
workers themselves and their children
and grandchildren&mdash;availed themselves much
more slowly and timidly of these spiritual
privileges than of the material ones. There
remained over from the feudal world a nucleus
of cultivated people, sufficiently homogeneous
in feeling to retain a standard of taste, sufficiently
numerous to exert an influence on
production: these were the guardians of the
better traditions. They were gradually but
steadily interpenetrated and overrun by the
emergents, at first in a minority but rapidly
becoming the majority, and remaining, of
course, unavoidably far more backward in
artistic feeling than in economic independence
and social ambition. Thus was introduced a
formidable cleavage in the musical public, the
majority breaking off sharply by their childlike
crudity from the more disciplined minority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation was further complicated by
the presence of a third class, the idle rich,
becoming more numerous under capitalism.
It may be doubted whether their attitude
towards art was qualitatively different in any
important respect from that of the frivolous
nobility under feudalism. Both groups regarded
music either with complete indifference
or else as an amusement, a plaything, a fad;
both exercised an influence which through its
essential artificiality was potentially perhaps
even more baleful than that of the honest
crudity of what we have called the emergent
class, though actually less disastrous because
they were a small minority instead of the majority.
But the contribution of this group to
the confusion and disorganization characteristic
of art under democracy was greater than
that of the feudal nobles, because their relation
to society as a whole counted more. When
they were placed by the emergence of the
democratic majority in a vigorous opposition
of attitude to the bulk of the people their influence
no longer remained largely negative,
but made positively for cleavage and disunion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Thus the unity of social emotion on
which art so largely depends for a healthy
universality was still further disrupted.</p>

<p>We find, then, under democracy, not a fairly
homogeneous musical public with emotionally
a single point of view, such as existed under
feudalism, but a division into a well-meaning
but crude majority and two minorities, one
cultivated, the other frivolous: all three, but
especially the two extremes, held apart by
profound differences of feeling. Despite the
inevitability and the desirability of democratization
as the only path away from slavery,
such a disorganization, even if temporary,
must evidently, while it lasts, work serious
injuries to art. It is worth while to try,
taking frankly at first the attitude of the devil's
advocate, to trace a few of the more striking of
these injuries as they show themselves in contemporary
music.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Of the "emergents" who constitute the
most novel element in the contemporary situation,
the well-meaning but crude listeners who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
form a numerically overwhelming majority
of our concert-goers, the effect may be described,
in most general terms, as being to
put a premium on all that is easily grasped,
obvious, primitive, at the expense of the subtler,
more highly organized effects of art&mdash;on
sensation as against thought, on facile sentiment
as against deep feeling, on extrinsic
association as against intrinsic beauty. Mentally,
emotionally, and æsthetically children,
they naturally demand the childlike, if not
the childish.</p>

<p>There seems to be something far deeper
than accident in the coincidence of the rise
about 1830, that is, about a generation after
the French Revolution, under Berlioz and Liszt,
of that program music which is generally
acknowledged to be peculiarly characteristic
of our period, with the invasion of concert-halls
by masses of these childlike listeners,
as eager for the stories that music might be
made to suggest as they were unprepared to
appreciate its more intrinsic beauties. They
were drawn by the "program" before they
grew up with the "music." Lacking the concentration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
needed to hold all but the simplest
melodies together in their minds, pathetically
incapable of the far greater range and precision
of attention required to hear synthetically
a complex work like an overture or a
symphony, they were puzzled or bored by
Beethoven, and in their helplessness to follow
a musical thread could only grope in the dark
until they found a dramatic one. Such a clue
in the labyrinth was the "program." They
hailed it with the delight of the comparatively
unmusical person in opera, who considers it the
highest type of music because it supplies him
with the largest apparatus of non-musical commentaries
(scenery, gestures, words) on the
music he cannot understand. Program music,
a sort of idealized opera with scenery and actors
left to the imagination, fulfilled the same indispensable
service for the novice in the concert-room.</p>

<p>The immense popularity of the program
idea, from that day to this, is evidence of its
complete fitness to the needs of its audience.
It says to them, in effect: "You have little
'ear' for music, and take no more joy in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
highly organized melodies of a Beethoven
symphony or a Bach fugue, with their infinite
subtlety of tonal and rhythmic relationships,
than in the most trivial tunes. Never mind: I
will give you two or three short motives, clearly
labeled, that you cannot help recognizing.
This one will mean 'love,' that 'jealousy,'
that 'death,' and so on.... You are not
fascinated by, because you are unable to follow,
the creative imagination by which such masters
as these build whole worlds of musical beauty
out of a few simple themes&mdash;an imagination
as truly creative as that which carried Newton
from the falling apple to the law of gravitation,
or directed the infinite patient delving in detail
of a Pasteur or a Darwin. Never mind.
Remember the story, and you will know that
during the love scene the composer must be
developing the 'love' motive.... You are
even more indifferent to the broader balance
of part with part, the symmetry and coöperation
of all in the whole, harder to grasp just
as the concinnity of a Greek temple as a whole
is harder to feel than the charm of a bit of
sculpture here or the texture of the marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
there. Never mind. I will give you a structure
in sections, like a sky-scraper. Section will
follow section as event follows event in the
plot.... In short, the story shall be 'All
you know, and all you need to know.' It
shall be a straw that will keep you from drowning
as the inundation of the music passes
over you, and that will save you the trouble
of learning to swim."</p>

<p>Of course, this does not mean that music
of a high order cannot be associated with a
program, or that the two cannot be not only
coexistent but fruitfully coöperative. They
are so in many a representative modern work&mdash;in
Strauss's "Death and Transfiguration,"
for instance, or d'lndy's "Istar," or Dukas's
"L'Apprenti Sorcier," or Rachmaninoff's
"Island of the Dead." What is meant is
that the program idea derives both its popularity
and its peculiar menace in large measure
from the stress it places on the appeal to something
outside music&mdash;to association, that is&mdash;at
the expense of the appeal to music itself,
and thus from the official sanction it seems to
give to what is essentially an unmusical conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of music. The program school of
composers is the first school that has not merely
tolerated but encouraged, elaborated, and
rationalized the conviction of the unmusical
that music is to be valued chiefly not for itself,
but for something else. How dangerous such
a compromise with the majority may be, both
to public taste and to the composer, is startlingly,
not to say tragically, illustrated by the
steady tendency of the greatest master of the
school, Richard Strauss, to become more and
more trivially "realistic" with each new work,
and by the complaisance of the public in paying
him vast sums of money for thus progressively
corrupting it. In every one of his
symphonic poems, from the exuberant "Don
Juan" (1888) to the surprisingly banal "Alpensymphonie"
(1915), glorious pages of music
have alternated with silly tricks of imitation,
as for instance the splendid development of
the husband theme in the "Symphonia Domestica"
with the bawling of the baby; but
in the latest we have the maximum of imitation
and the minimum of music. Apart from
their gorgeous orchestral dress its themes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with few exceptions commonplace, dull, and
pretentious. Except in one or two passages
they are not imaginatively or significantly
developed. On the other hand there is no
end of "tone-painting," much of it a revamping
of the distant-hunting-horns, rustling-leaves,
and warbling-bird-calls which have been timeworn
theatrical properties of music ever since
Raff's "Im Walde" and Wagner's "Waldweben";
some of it more original, like the
pictures of sunrise and sunset with which
the work begins and ends. In these associatively
vivid but musically amorphous passages
melody, harmony, rhythm, key disappear in a
strange opaque cloud of tone, realistically
representing night&mdash;the kind of night to
which the German wit compared Hegel's
Absolute&mdash;"in which all cows are black."
The same childish realism which made Wagner
show us his dragon on the stage instead of in
our own imaginations introduces a wind-machine
in the storm and sheep bells in the
mountain pasture. In all this we see an
artist who was once capable of writing the introduction
and coda of "Death and Transfiguration"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
taking his art into the nursery to
play games with.</p>

<p>But the effect of music on childlike audiences,
indisposed to active mental effort and
all for taking music passively like a kind of
tonal Turkish bath, reaches its logical extreme
not in the program music of which Strauss is
the most famous exponent, but in that superficially
different but fundamentally related
movement known as impressionism, which is
led by the other most discussed composer of
our day, Debussy. Strikingly contrasted as
are these two leaders of contemporary music
in temperament, in artistic aims, in technical
methods, their æsthetic theories are at one in
the slight demands they make on the attention
of an inevitably inattentive public. Both
encourage the listener to look away from the
music itself to something that it suggests to
him. But impressionism goes further than
programmism. May not those people, it says,
who find organic melody, development, and
form fatiguing, and to whom you give a program
to help them out&mdash;may they not find
the program fatiguing, too? May not its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
being prescribed offend their sense of "freedom"?
Why exact of them the effort to
follow even the story? Better to give them
simply a title, as vague and elusive as possible,
and foster the mood of day-dreaming
thus suggested by avoiding all definite melodic,
rhythmic, or harmonic features in the music,
while enhancing its purely sensuous charm to
the utmost degree possible. Such, carried
out with extraordinary talent, is the artistic
creed of Debussy. Just as programmism appeals
from music to association, impressionism
appeals to sentiment, to fancy, and to the
phantasmagoric reveries upon which they are
ever so ready to embark.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy, moreover, that both programmism
and impressionism, however systematically
they may minimize their demands
on the intelligence of their audience, do not
abate, but rather tend constantly to increase,
their ministration to its sense. Indeed, they
systematically maximize their sensuous appeal;
and though their characteristic methods
of making this appeal differ as widely as their
general attitudes, that of programmism being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
extensive and that of impressionism intensive,
the insistence of both on sensuous rather than
on intellectual or emotional values is surely
one of the most indicative, and it may be added
one of the most disquieting, symptoms of the
condition of modern music.</p>

<p>The method of the program school in general,
and of Strauss in particular, is extensive in
that it aims at boundless piling up of means,
a formidable accumulation of sonorities for
the besieging of the ear. Its motto is that
attributed to the German by the witty Frenchman:
"Plenty of it." Berlioz, the pioneer
of the movement, with his "mammoth orchestras,"
and his prescription, in his requiem, of
four separate brass bands, one at each corner
of the church, and eight pairs of kettle-drums
in addition to bass drum, gong, and cymbals;
Mahler, commencing a symphony with a solo
melody for eight horns; Strauss, with his
twelve horns behind the scenes in the "Alpensymphonie,"
to say nothing of wind-machine,
thunder-machine, sheep bells, and a whole
regiment of more usual instruments&mdash;all
these disciples of the extensive or quantitative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
method aim to dazzle, stun, bewilder, and
overwhelm. They can be recognized by their
abuse of the brass and percussion groups, their
childlike faith that if a noise is only loud
enough it becomes noble. They have a tendency,
too, to mass whole groups of instruments
on a single "part," as Tschaikowsky, for instance,
so often does with his strings, whatever
the sacrifice of interesting detail, for the
sake of brilliance and <cite>éclat</cite>. To some extent,
of course, all this is justified, even necessitated,
by the vast size of modern concert-halls; but
a candid observer can hardly deny that it is
systematically overdone in the interests of
sensationalism. The same tendency is observable
also in other than orchestral music.
The piano, treated with such admirable restraint
by Chopin and by Debussy, has been
forced by Liszt and his followers toward jangling,
crashing sonorities that can penetrate the
most callous sensorium. The equipment of
organs with "solo stops" and other devices
for the tickling of idle ears has turned the king
of instruments too often into a holiday harlequin.
Even the string quartet, last rallying-ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of music against the ubiquitous
onslaught of sensationalism, begins in many
modern scores, with their constant double
stops and tremolos, and their "effects" of
mutes, pizzicato, "ponticello," "col legno,"
and the rest, to sound like a rather poor,
thin orchestra, striving for a variety and fulness
of color beyond its capacity.</p>

<p>The fallacy of the extensive method is that
it is trying to satisfy a craving essentially insatiable.
Such an appetite for mere quantity
of sound grows by what it feeds on; luxury
breeds ennui; and, as every sensualist knows
to his sorrow, there never can be "plenty of
it." A sense of this futility inherent in the
extensive method as it has been practised in
modern Germany and elsewhere has led another
school, chiefly modern French, to try for similar
results by a different method, which may
be called the intensive. Such a composer as
Debussy, who may here be taken as typical,
aims, to be sure, primarily at sensuous rather
than at mental or spiritual values, but achieves
them by qualitative refinement and contrast
rather than by quantitative accumulation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and avoids exaggeration in favor of a delicate,
almost finical, understatement and suggestiveness.
While sonority is as much his god as
Strauss's, he is the connoisseur of subtle, elusive
sonorities, each to be sipped like a wine of
rarest bouquet, rather than an enthusiast of
the full-bodied brew. The subtlety of the
methods often leads his admirers to claim a
superior "spirituality" in the aims, but this
is a mistake. His school is more spiritual than
Strauss's only as a <cite>gourmet</cite> is more spiritual
than a glutton. Both schools prefer sensation
to thought and emotion, association to intrinsic
beauty, color to line. The difference is that
"Pelléas et Mélisande" is the violet or ultraviolet
end of the spectrum of which "Salome"
is the red.</p>

<p>A curious by-product of the cult of the
elusive sonority is the exaggerated, the almost
morbid, interest that has emanated from
modern France in novelty of harmonic idiom.
One would suppose, to read many contemporary
critics, that the sole criterion of a good composer
depended on his use of some recondite
scheme of harmony, whether based on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
whole-tone scale, on the mediæval modes, on
new applications of chromaticism, on the "harmonic
polyphony" of Casella and others, or
on the arbitrary asperities of the Italian noise-makers
and Mr. Leo Ornstein. If you wish
to be considered an "ultra-modernist" you
may do quite as you please, both as regards
commission and omission, in rhythm, melody,
polyphony, form, provided only you are harmonically
eccentric. This insistence on harmony,
on the momentary tone-combination,
suggests a predominant concern with the
sensuous side of music which is highly significant
as a symptom. It is a stressing of that which
the senses alone can perceive from moment
to moment, without any aid from memory,
imagination, comparison, and other mental
acts required for the perception of rhythm and
melody. In short, it is an evidence of the
same materialistic tendency to rely on the
physical rather than the mental appeal, on
the investiture of the idea rather than on the
idea itself, which we noted in the extensive
method. Whatever their differences, both
methods are thus at one in the tendency to use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
materials as makeshifts for thought. Mahler
failing to get with eight horns the effect that
Schubert got with two&mdash;plus a great melodic
idea&mdash;at the opening of his C Major Symphony,
Debussy confectioning a banal bit of
tune in muted string or pastoral flute sonorities
with piquant harmonies&mdash;both are appealing,
with varying success, from our minds and hearts
to our auditory nerves. The increasing measure
of success attending such appeals shows
vividly the numerical advantage that the hungry
or curious auditory nerves have, in the
modern democratic audience, over the enlightened
minds and hearts.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>And indeed, how should we expect it to be
otherwise? Enlightened minds and hearts,
we must remember, are the finest and rarest
fruits of civilization, to be cultivated only under
conditions of decent leisure, fair physical and
mental health, and free association with "the
best that has been done and thought in the
world." When they are so rare even in the
class that has all these advantages, how shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
we expect them to be common among those
living either in an industrial servitude that
for monotony of toil is almost worse than
chattel slavery, or by clerical and other secondary
work that through the modern specialization
and subdivision of labor condemns each
individual to a more or less mechanical repetition
of a few small acts through the larger
part of his working hours, a routine the relation
of which to human life as a whole he often
does not see? Writers on sociology are beginning
to realize<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that such conditions of
work inevitably produce a morbid psychological
condition in the worker, dulling his mind by
the meaningless drudgery and depressing his
body and nerves by fatigue-poisons, so that
even in his few hours of leisure his perfectly
natural seeking for pleasure does not take
entirely normal paths. Too exhausted to respond
to delicate shades and subtle relationships,
whether in sensuous or mental objects,
his jaded nerves cry out for violent stimuli, for
sharp contrasts, for something to goad and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
whip them into new activity. This craving for
violent stimuli is the essential feature of the
fatigue-psychology. Now, is it not highly
suggestive that the age of industrialism is also
the age of a hundred goads for tired nerves&mdash;of
the newspaper headline, the dime-novel and
"penny-thriller," the lurid moving-picture
drama, ragtime and the "revue"? And is it
not possible that the sensationalism of so
much modern music is only another evidence,
on a somewhat higher plane, of the working
of this same psychology of fatigue?</p>

<p>Again, these overworn nerves of ours have
within a comparatively short period had brought
to bear upon them, through the progress of
modern invention with its cheap printing, quick
transportation, and long distance communication,
a thousand distractions. No longer insulated
from the outlying world, so to speak,
by time and space, as were our more simply-living
ancestors, we read, hear, and see as much
in a day as they did in a week. The inevitable
result has been a diffusion of attention fatal
to concentrated thought except for the most
resolute, breeding in the average man mental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
indigestion and habits of disorder and impatience,
and gradually evolving the characteristic
modern type&mdash;quick, sharp, and shallow.
Outward distraction has thus added its influence
to inner weariness to urge our art
away from quiet thought towards ever noisier
solicitation. For thought always depends on
simplification, on inhibition: in order to think
we must neglect the given-by-sense, as we see
strikingly in the case of the absent-minded, in
order to attend to the given-by-memory-and-imagination;
and over-stimulation of sense is
therefore just as hostile to thought as the depression
of the higher mental faculties through
fatigue. Thus it is highly characteristic of
our prevailing attitude that we strive, not
for elimination, but for accumulation, distraction,
dissipation. The formula is always
mental apathy, physical and nervous excitement.
Not having the joy of the mastery
which comes only through thought, because
we lack both concentration and favorable
opportunity to discipline ourselves, we seek
the stimulus of constant change. We digest
nothing, taste everything; "eclecticism" is our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
euphemism for spreading our attention very
wide and very thin; and the nightmare that
you soon uncover under all our art is not that
our minds may become bewildered (for that
they are already), but that our senses may become
jaded&mdash;which of course they do.</p>

<p>Still another line of influence that may be
traced from general modern conditions to the
peculiar qualities of modern art concerns especially
the third of the classes described above,
the capitalist class. Here again we find a
morbid condition, a distortion of wholesome
human contacts; but here instead of the impediment
of meaningless drudgery, it is the
incubus of a fruitless, selfish idleness. Cut
off from the normal outlet of energy in useful
work, the luxurious classes become pampered
and bored, and develop through very vacuity
a perverted taste for the unusual, the queer,
the generally upside down and backside to.
Every season sees a new crop of the "isms"
thus produced, the ephemera of the world of
art, which live a day and die as soon as they
lose their one interest, novelty. Of all manifestations
of so-called "art" they are the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sterile, the most completely devoid of vital
relation to any real impulse. They might be
ignored did they not complicate still further
an already complicated situation, and were
they not an additional, though a largely negative,
illustration of the close causative relation
between general social conditions and artistic
expression that our discussion is making more
and more evident. Fortunately they produce
little enduring effect beyond their own narrow
circles; for as they spring not from any vital
interest, but only from an unguided curiosity
and desire for excitement, they take mutually
opposing forms and largely cancel each other.
Thus, for instance, fads for very old or for
very new music, directed as they are toward
the mere age or the mere newness, and having
no concern with the quality of the music itself,
leave the actual public taste just where it
would have been had they never arisen.
Nevertheless the diversion of so much energy,
which might under better conditions find an
outlet in fruitful activity, to a sterile posture-making,
is uneconomical and to be regretted.</p>

<p>So far, we have been looking chiefly from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the point of view of the devil's advocate, at
the injurious influences on contemporary music
that can be traced with some degree of plausibility
to the capitalistic and industrial social
system of the nineteenth century. Noting
the sensational bent, whether extensively or
intensively expressing itself, of the chief contemporary
schools, we have asked ourselves
whether it could be attributed in some measure
to the kind of demand made by an audience
dulled by overwork at monotonous tasks and
depressed by fatigue-poisons. Remarking the
multiplicity of fads and "isms" by which our
art is confused, we have asked how far these
might be attributed to the cravings of a group
whose normal appetites have been perverted
by luxury and self-centered isolation. All of
these evils, we have insisted, are aggravated
in their effects by the distractions under which
we live. It is now time, however, taking a
more positive view and attempting a more
constructive theory, to ask how these evils
may be combated, what more hopeful elements
already exist in the situation, and what
others may be expected to develop in the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>First of all, it may be suggested that, so far
as these evils are fairly attributable to the
social conditions of the nineteenth century,
they may fairly be expected to be mitigated
somewhat by those changes which already seem
probable in those of the twentieth. The
capitalistic era seems likely to be followed by
an era of coöperation or communism; and in
countless ways such a change must eventually
be deeply revivifying to all forms of art. Of
course, it is only too easy to indulge in baseless
dreams of the results upon art of a millennium
brought about in this way, only too easy to
forget that we are only at the threshold of such
new systems of organization, and that they
may go the wrong way instead of the right.
All we can safely say is that if they do go the
right way they will rescue art, among many
other human interests, from the condition to
which much of it has been prostituted under
capitalism.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for instance, that something
like what Mr. H. G. Wells calls the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
State<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> eventually results from the troublous
reconstructions through which we are living.
The Great State is only one of three possibilities
he sees in the further adjustment of
the leisure class and the labor class of our
present order. The first possibility (and a
disagre vivid one it must seem to all
thoughtful Americans) is that "the leisure class
may degenerate into a waster class," and the
labor class "may degenerate into a sweated,
overworked, violently resentful and destructive
rebel class," and that a social <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle</i> may
result. The second possibility is that the
leisure class "may become a Governing Class
(with waster elements) in an unprogressive
Bureaucratic Servile State," in which the other
class appears as a "controlled, regimented,
and disciplined Labour Class." The third
possibility is that the leisure class "may become
the whole community of the Great State,
working under various motives and inducements,
but not constantly, nor permanently,
nor unwillingly," while the labor class is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"rendered needless by a general labour conscription,
together with a scientific organization
of production, and so re-absorbed by reendowment
into the Leisure Class of the Great
State."</p>

<p>The first two of these possible conditions
would be fatal to art, one through anarchy
and loss of standards, the other through conventionalization.
The third would bring about
a renascence, after a troubled period of conflicting
standards and of readjustments such
as we find ourselves in to-day. The main
elements in such a progress would be, first,
the gradual refining, deepening, and vitalizing
of the taste of the general public under the
influence of increasing leisure, health, self-respect,
and education; second, the cutting
off of extravagance, luxury, and faddism in the
wealthier classes by a wholesome pressure of
enforced economy; third, increasing solidarity
of feeling in the whole social fabric through
such a mutual <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapprochement</i>, giving the indispensable
emotional basis for vital art.</p>

<p>There are already some encouraging evidences
of such developments. Much preparatory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
work towards the formation of better
standards of public taste has been unobtrusively
done, at least in our larger cities, by free lectures
and cheap recitals and concerts. Two
disadvantages, however, have often attended
such work, reducing its benefits. One has
come from the common fallacy that what is
done for the many must be done so as to please
the many&mdash;a view often supposed to be
"democratic." Emerson was more truly democratic
when he told us to "cease this idle prating
about the masses," and set about extracting
individuals from them; for real democracy
never forgets that the majority are always
inferior, and its aim must be to give the superior
minority a chance to make their influence
felt. In other words, to level down to the
people is to vulgarize rather than to popularize.
Theodore Thomas set a model for the conductor
of popular concerts in the best sense, for all
time, when he replied to one of his orchestra
players who said that people did not like Wagner:
"Then we must play him until they do."</p>

<p>The second disadvantage is even harder to
avoid, even for administrators of the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
standards, because it seems to be almost intrinsic
in this kind of work. It comes from
the passive nature of the people's participation.
Giving even the best concerts seems
often too much like handing the people music
at the end of a stick&mdash;"Take it or leave it";
naturally, having so little choice in its selection,
they often leave it; and even when they
try their best to take it, they cannot get so
much out of it as if they were actively helping
to produce it. This is the reason that more
active forms of music-making, even if crude,
like the music school settlement work and
the community choruses that have been making
such strides in recent years, seem so full
of promise. The singing in the public schools,
too, would have done far more than it has,
had not the standards been debased, as Mr.
T. W. Surette has ably shown,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to the childish
tastes, not of the children themselves, who
could appreciate better things, but of their
dull and routine-enslaved elders. Yet here
again we must beware of a too easy optimism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>There is no magic about the community chorus
that can suddenly change bad taste to good.
Too often we seem here, as in all other activities
for popularizing music, to oscillate helplessly
between two evils. On the one hand is
the crudity of actual taste: the majority
prefer ragtime and the musical comedies to
folk-songs or the simple classics. On the other
hand is the apathy that comes of prescriptions
from outsiders: musical activity that is not
spontaneous is sterile. Progress seems to come
painfully and uncertainly from a constant
zigzagging between these two evils, getting
gradually away from them as the taste of the
minority exercises its persuasiveness.</p>

<p>As for the wealthier classes, it must be confessed
that there are so far few evidences of
any permanent displacement of luxury and
artificiality by saner and simpler tastes. Yet
there are even here one or two hopeful signs,
of which the most conspicuous is the recent
enthusiasm for folk-songs. This is rather too
good to be altogether true. It is hard to believe
in the complete sincerity of those who go
into the same rhapsodies over a perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
simple and rather crude peasant song that a
year or two ago they reserved for the exquisite
day-dreams of Debussy or the exotic inconsequentialities
of Cyril Scott. Moreover, the
appreciation of folk-song, though a normal and
indeed indispensable stage in musical education,
is only the very first phase of initiation
to the deeper and subtler beauties of musical
art, and not a stage to be dwelt in with complacency.
Yet so far as it goes, and in the
measure of its sincerity, the interest in folk-song
is of good augury. It means concern
with melody, always and everywhere the soul
of music, rather than with externalities like
orchestral color, or harmonic "effects," or
quasi-poetic associations and programs. It
means sympathy with simple and broadly
human, universal emotions, such as inspire the
greatest as well as such primitive music. It
may mean the beginning of a real and eventually
a developed taste for good music. And
it is a good foundation for such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapprochement</i>
of all classes of music-lovers as may
come, we may hope, with the coming of the
Great State.</p>

<p>If our cursory examination of the general
tendencies of our day reveals no striking preponderance
of good over bad, shows us no
movement of any majority that we can acclaim
without qualification, we may now remind
ourselves for our comfort that this has always
been the case in all times, and that there is
indeed a curious illusion, resolvable only by
close scrutiny, that makes our own time seem
worse to us, in comparison with others, than
it really is. We have to remember that the
baser elements of our own time make a much
greater impression on us, in relation to the
finer ones, than those of the past. A living
fool can make as much noise as a wise man
(if not far more); a dead one is silent forever.
The gold of Beethoven's day, of which he was
himself the purest nugget, comes down to us
bright and untarnished, so that we forget all
the dross that has been thrown on the scrapheap
of time. Our own gold is almost hidden
from us by the glitter of the tinsel.</p>

<p>"The world of music," says Sir Charles
Stanford,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "is not substantially different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
what it has been. It has always exalted those
of its contemporary composers who dealt in
frills and furbelows above those who considered
the body more important than its
clothes. Only a few wise heads knew of the
existence of Bach. Rossini was rated by the
mass of the public far higher than Weber,
Spohr than Beethoven, Meyerbeer than Wagner.
Simrock said that he made Böhm pay
for Brahms."</p>

<p>It is always necessary to wait for the winnowing
process of time before we can see the true
proportions of an age. Hence we can never
see our own age in its true proportions, and
since the second- and third-rate elements in it
are ever more acclaimed by the majority than
the first-rate, we always see it worse than it is.
We live, so to speak, in the glare of noon-day,
and cannot see the true coloring of our world,
which will appear only at evening. Hence
in every age the tragi-comedy is repeated of
acclaiming the mediocre and the meretricious,
and ignoring worth. The Gounods always
patronize the Francks. The answer of philosophy
is Emerson's:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ideas impregnable: numbers are nothing.
Who knows what was the population of Jerusalem?
'Tis of no importance whatever.
We know that the Saint and a handful of
people held their great thoughts to the death;
and the mob resisted and killed him: and, at
the hour, fancied they were up and he was
down; when, at that very moment, the fact
was the reverse. The principles triumphed
and had begun to penetrate the world. And
'tis never of any account how many or how rich
people resist a thought."</p>

<p>Our final question, then, resolves itself to
this: Are there in the music of our day, known
or unknown to the majority, any such vital
"thoughts," based on principles that a discerning
criticism may see even now to have
"triumphed and begun to penetrate the
world"? Is there music being written to-day
which is modern, not through its pampering to
jaded sense or dulled intelligence, but through
its intuition and expression of the deeper emotional
experience and spiritual aspiration of
our time? Is there music, in short, not only
seductive to the ear but beautiful to the mind?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
To answer such a question intelligently we
shall have to take account of certain truths
which the foregoing discussion has tended to
establish, and which may now be made explicit.
Thought, emotion, all that we call the
spiritual side of music, expresses itself not
through sonorous or harmonic effects, primarily
sensuous in appeal, but through melody and
rhythm and their interplay and elaboration
in so-called thematic development. In truly
great music we remember, not such and such
a bit of tone-color, not this or that sonority,
but the soaring or tender curve of the themes,
their logical yet ever new unfolding, their
embodiment, in the whole composition, of
richest variety with completest final unity.
The man in the street is absolutely right in
feeling that music succeeds or fails by its tunes;
his limitation arises in his conception of "tune."</p>

<p>Again, since the creation and manipulation
of great "tunes" or themes, unlike the hitting
off of sonorous effects or the discovery of
<em>rococo</em> harmonies, comes never by luck, but
only through a discipline based on the assimilation
of all that is best in music, we always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
find that all really fine music is firmly founded
upon tradition, and reaches its roots into the
past, while blossoming, so to speak, into the
future. The artist, despite the popular supposition
to the contrary, depends on his forerunners
quite as closely as the scientist. You
can no more write a solid sonata without knowing
Beethoven than you can work efficiently
in biology in ignorance of Darwin. Yet on
the other hand this assimilation of the past
has to produce, not an academic and sterile
complacency with what is, but an equipped
and curious advance upon what is to be: the
artist, like the scientist, brings all his learning
to the test in acts of creative imagination, leaps
in the dark. Thus artistic advance may be
figured as like the shooting of frost crystals
on a window pane; never is there a crystal
that is not firmly attached by traceable lines
to the main body; yet no one can prophesy
whither each fine filament may strike out in
its individual adventure. The great artist is
bound to the past by love and docility, to the
future by a faith that overleaps convention.</p>

<p>Looked at in the light of these considerations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
contemporary music presents a scheme of light
and shade somewhat different from that ordinarily
accepted. If some high lights are overshadowed,
others seem to shine more brightly.
There is plenty of hopeful promise for the
future. Leaving aside the sounder elements
in Strauss and Debussy, in whom there is so
much of the richness of decay, we shall find
the chief centers of truly creative activity
perhaps in three composers who in their differing
ways and degrees carry on the great tradition:
Rachmaninoff in Russia, Elgar in
England, and d'Indy in France. Each of
these men reaches back roots to the primal
sources of musical life&mdash;Bach and Beethoven:
Rachmaninoff through Tschaikowsky, the eclectic
Elgar through Mendelssohn, Brahms, Wagner,
and others, and d'Indy through Wagner
and Franck. Each, as we see in such
modern classics as "Toteninsel," the A flat
Symphony, and "Istar," can create, in settings
of modern opulence of color, nobly beautiful
forms, melodies that live and soar in a spiritual
heaven. All, too, though in varying degrees,
move on as creators should toward the unknown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Here the Frenchman has perhaps,
with his characteristic lucidity and logic, something
the advantage of the more sensuous
Slav and the more convention-beset Anglo-Saxon.
Rachmaninoff, for all his warmth,
does not always escape the vulgarity of Tschaikowsky,
and Elgar cannot always forget the
formulæ of oratorio. But in d'Indy, with his
untrammeled experimental attitude toward
all modern possibilities, we have an influence
destined steadily to grow and already clearly
suggesting an epoch combining the best of the
old ways with new ones at which we can for
the present only guess.</p>

<h2>II<br />
<br />
<small>RICHARD STRAUSS</small></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The chronology of Richard
Strauss's artistic life up to the
present time arranges itself
almost irresistibly in the traditional
three periods, albeit in his
case the philosophy of these periods has to be
rather different from that, say, of Beethoven's.
"Discipline, maturity, eccentricity," we say
with sufficient accuracy in describing Beethoven's
development. The same formula for
Strauss will perhaps be tempting to those for
whom the perverse element in the Salome-Elektra
period is the most striking one; but it
is safer to say simply: "Music, program music,
and music drama." Born in 1864, he produced
during his student years, up to 1886, a great
quantity of well-made and to some extent personal
music, obviously influenced by Mendelssohn,
Schumann, and Brahms, and comprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sonatas, quartets, concertos, and a
symphony. He himself has told how he then
came under the influence of Alexander Ritter,
and through him of Wagner, Berlioz, and
Liszt; how this influence toward "the poetic,
the expressive, in music" acted upon him "like
a storm wind"; and how the "Aus Italien,"
written in 1886, is the connecting link between
his earlier work and the series of
symphonic poems that follows in the second
period. The chief titles and dates of this
remarkable series may be itemized here:
"Macbeth," 1886-7; "Don Juan," 1888; "Tod
und Verklärung," 1889; "Till Eulenspiegel"
and "Also Sprach Zarathustra," 1894; "Don
Quixote," 1897; "Ein Heldenleben," 1898;
and the "Symphonia Domestica," 1903. The
period of program music, containing also, of
course, other works such as the operas "Guntram"
and "Feuersnot," innumerable songs,
and a violin sonata strayed from the first period,
thus lasts from his twenty-second to his thirty-ninth
year. Since then Strauss has devoted
himself chiefly to works for the stage, comprising
"Salome" (1906), "Elektra" (1908),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"Der Rosenkavalier" (1911), "Ariadne auf
Naxos," (1913), and "Josephs Legende"
(1914). His latest work is again in the
province of instrumental music&mdash;an "Alpine
Symphony."</p>

<p>This rapid survey of Strauss's creative activity
shows that the natural bent of his mind
is toward the realistic and dramatic side of
his art; it was only in his youth, before he had
found himself, that he wrote self-sufficing
music; and though lyrical power is shown in
many of his songs and in passages of almost
all the orchestral works, yet it is on the whole
true to say that the essential Strauss is Strauss
the dramatist. And if we ask ourselves what
are the qualities of temperament requisite to a
dramatist, we shall find in Strauss's possession
of them in altogether unusual measure
the key to his commanding position among the
musico-dramatists of our day.</p>

<p>These qualities are the same for a dramatic
artist who works in tones as for one who works
in words. First of all he must be a man of
keen observation, of penetrating intelligence,
able to note all that passes about him and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
interpret it with something of cold scientific
precision. He must be able to seize human
types and divine human motives quite different
from his own, as they are objectively.
He must resist distorting them by reading
into them his own impulses and sentiments, as
a man of more subjective temperament and
less critical detachment always does. In short,
he must be of the active rather than the contemplative
type, and have a good measure of
that faculty of impersonal intellectual curiosity
which gives a Shakespeare his supreme power
of objective observation.</p>

<p>But though he must not distort others by
viewing them through himself, he must nevertheless
interpret them through reference to his
own feelings, since these are the only feelings
with which he is directly acquainted. That
is to say, he must be able to place himself, by
sympathetic imagination, at the points of
view of those he studies. Such sympathetic
imagination is so very different a thing from
subjective distortion that without it no real
understanding of one's fellows is possible at
all. The great dramatist needs, then, deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and rich emotion, quite as much as the lyric
singer&mdash;but emotion ever guided by the sympathy
which brings it into play. It is this
emotion, guided by sympathetic imagination,
that gives the very aspect of life, and its power
to move us, to the creation that mere intellectual
observation alone could never vitalize.</p>

<p>And finally, the dramatic artist, besides
observing keenly and interpreting sympathetically,
must view all that he sees with a
certain magnanimous many-sidedness, a sort
of sweet and mellow wisdom, which is hard
to describe but unmistakable when encountered.
We find it in all really great creative artists,
who seem to view life not only keenly, not only
sympathetically, but also wisely and as if from
above, from that vantage point of a wider insight
than that of any of their subjects, so that
in their summing up of them they are able to
set them in proper relation one to another,
and by so doing to get a true and calm picture
of human life as a whole. This power of
philosophic or poetic vision, this magnanimity,
we instinctively demand of the artist. It satisfies
a fundamental human craving. The moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in the fable is a naïve embodiment of it; it
comes even into the uncongenial atmosphere
of the light comedy of manners in the rhymed
epilogue; its musical incarnation we find in
many of the quiet codas of Brahms, or in the
thoughtful "Der Dichter spricht" at the end
of Schumann's "Kinderscenen."</p>

<p>The object of the present essay is to show that
Strauss has, in unequal but high degree, these
qualities of the dramatist: observation, sympathy,
and magnanimity. The first he has in
almost unparalleled measure; the second somewhat
fitfully, sometimes inhibited by his ironic
cynicism; the third in his most genial moods,
as for instance, in the epilogue to "Till Eulenspiegel,"
but not when misled by over-realistic
aims. The evidence of his possession of these
qualities that we shall especially look for will
be not that afforded by his acts or his sayings,
but rather the irrefragable testimony of his
musical works themselves.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Since a man's temperament is what ultimately
determines the peculiar combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of qualities making up his artistic individuality&mdash;his
characteristic powers and shortcomings&mdash;the
first questions we have to ask ourselves
regarding any artist we propose to study will
always be: "What is his temperament?"
"To which of the two great types does it belong,
the active or the contemplative?" "Does
its power lie primarily in observation or in introspection?"
"Does it impel him towards
objective characterization or toward the utterance
of subjective feeling?" Elsewhere,
in studying these antitheses of temperament
in particular cases, such as those of Mendelssohn
and Schumann,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and of Saint-Saëns
and Franck,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> occasion has been taken to discuss
in some detail the rationale of their musical expression.
At present our interest is in finding
in Strauss a rather extreme case of the
active temperament, a man of positively explosive
nervous energy.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to assemble a few of his
characteristic melodic motives to see that this
energy naturally translates itself, melodically,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
into wide erratic skips and incisive abrupt
rhythms. Here are a few of them:</p>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p52e.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The chief theme of the arch mischief-maker,
"Till Eulenspiegel," is necessarily capricious,
but it is doubtful if even for him anyone but
Strauss would have thought of those surprising
jumps, landing each time on an unexpected
note. In the main theme of "Don Juan" we
have a good example of his rhythmic energy.
Note the variety of the figures: the sixteenth
notes in the first measure, swarming up to the
high E; the still further ascending triplet;
the even more incisive dotted group leading
to the emphatic half notes. In similar general
style is the chief theme of "Ein Heldenleben,"
depicting the hero, but less lithe, more burly
and almost awkwardly powerful. The theme
of "great longing" from "Also Sprach Zarathustra"
conveys its impression through the
wide jumps, covering almost three octaves in
two vigorous dashes. The theme of "the
Wife," from the "Symphonia Domestica,"
illustrates Strauss's love of turning the unexpected
way. Notice the downward jump of
a ninth, and the cadence transferred to a higher
octave than we expect.</p>

<p>The same story of overflowing nervous energy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
is told by two other characteristics of
Strauss's melody. Like all sanguine natures
he has more rising than falling phrases. The
buoyancy of (<em>b</em>), (<em>c</em>), and (<em>d</em>) in Figure I is
irrepressible; (<em>a</em>) has a falling curve, somewhat
coy; (<em>e</em>) begins in the same wheedling vein,
but ends with a rise of self-confident energy.
A canvass of all the motives in the symphonic
poems would probably demonstrate that seventy-five
per cent of them rise in pitch. The
second peculiarity is more subtle but even more
significant&mdash;a preference for "rising" or anacrustic
rhythms, culminating in an accented
final note after several unaccented ones, to
"falling" or thetic rhythms beginning with the
heavy part of the measure. The elasticity of
the rising rhythm is clearly shown in all the
excerpts of Figure I except that from "Ein
Heldenleben"; that, naturally, begins doggedly
on the down beat. Only a systematic
study can show the extent of Strauss's addiction
to the rising rhythm.</p>

<p>These considerations, to which might perhaps
be added his preference for the major to
the minor mode, and for the vigorous duple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to the more subtle triple meter, afford us quite
ample internal evidence of his belonging to the
temperamental type of the actives, like Mendelssohn
and Saint-Saëns (however he may
differ from them musically) rather than to that
of the contemplatives,&mdash;the Schumanns and
the Francks. To these positive points we
might add negative ones, dealing with his
emotional shortcomings. This, indeed, we
shall have to do later, in the interest of a just
critical estimate; but for the present it will
be better worth while to examine the positive
results, in the way of keen observation and
masterly characterization, of this active-minded
interest of Strauss in what lies about
him.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Strauss's characterization is consummate.
Superlatives are dangerous, but probably no
other musician has ever carried to such a point
the power of music to depict, or at least, to suggest,
varieties of character, both in human
beings and in inanimate objects. Strauss's
reported remark that music was becoming so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
definite that we should soon be able to portray
a tablespoon so unmistakably that it
could be told from the rest of the silverware
is probably an instance of his sardonic delight
in hoaxing the public; but if anyone is going
to subject the art of tones to this curious test,
we are all agreed, doubtless, that it should be
Strauss himself. Meanwhile, failing a tablespoon,
we have a sufficiently varied collection
of portraits in his gallery, each sketched with
a Sargent-like penetration.</p>

<p>We have seen, for example, in Figure I<em>a</em>,
Till Eulenspiegel the arch mischief-maker, irrepressible,
incorrigible. Here, on the other
hand, is Till sentimental, making love to a
village maiden, his original insolence tamed
into a simpering persuasiveness, his theme, at
first so galvanic, now languishing in its plaintive
downward droopings (Figure II, page 57).
Later we see him, repulsed by the maiden,
storming in ungovernable fury.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p57_iii.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Here, again, belonging to a quite other world,
is Don Quixote, "the knight of the sorrowful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
visage," aging and broken, yet full of chivalrous
and idealistic notions, and thus at once
inspiring and pathetic (Figure III, page 57).
What a contrast is his rascal of a servant,
Sancho Panza, good-natured and irresponsible,
sauntering through life with a minimum of
effort and a maximum of diversion:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p58-fig-iv.jpg" width="500" height="153" alt="imp58" />
<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Figure IV.</span> Sancho Panza.</p>
</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p58.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>


<p>We find a somewhat similar principle of contrast,
though between very different types
of character, in the themes of the husband and
the wife in the "Symphonia Domestica." The
latter has been cited at Figure I<em>e</em>. Its suggestion
of coy graciousness and feminine charm
is due in part to the tender downward inflections
of the opening figure, and partly to
the anacrustic rhythm (beginning with unaccented
notes). The theme of the husband,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with which the work opens, starts out with an
"inversion" of this three-note figure of the
wife: the motives complementary to each
other, so to speak, as if Strauss had wished to
suggest the reciprocal relation of marriage.
Yet the rising inflection and the falling rhythm
of the husband version give it a vigor that completely
differentiates it from the other, even
if we ignore for the moment the effect of the
contrasting keys of F major and B major, a
matter of which we shall have more to say
presently.</p>

<p>The subtlety of the composer's use of rhythm
for characterization can hardly be exaggerated.
It almost justifies the extreme detail of his
annotator's analyses, as for example of Mr.
Wilhelm Klatte's diagnosis of the hero's character
in "Ein Heldenleben." This reads like
an old-fashioned phrenological chart. Mr.
Klatte finds in his hero "a genial nature, emotional
and vibratory" (measures 1-6 and
9-12 of the opening theme), a "haughty and
firm step" (measures 6-8), and an "indomitable
will" (measures 13-16). Furthermore the
continuation in B major and A flat, Mr. Klatte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tells us, shows that the paragon has "richness
of fantasy, warmth and elasticity of feeling,
allied with lightness of movement&mdash;whose
tendency is always toward buoyancy and
onward and upward effort, thus imparting an
effect of inflexible and well-directed determination
instead of low-spirited or sullen obstinacy."
Mr. Klatte makes a considerable
demand on our powers of credence. Yet we
must be reluctant to place limits to a power
of rhythmo-melodic suggestion that can give
us such extremes of opposed character as the
naïve innocence of the "Childhood" motive
in "Tod und Verklärung," and the degenerate
superstition and pathological fear of
Herodias, with her eerie whole-tone scale, in
"Salome."</p>

<p>Highly characteristic of Strauss, both in its
subtle use of rhythmo-melodic characterization
and in the rather malicious quality of its humor,
is the "Science" section in "Also Sprach
Zarathustra." This powerful if over-ambitious
work deals with a matter that can hardly be
put into music, even by Strauss: with the
opposition, namely, between the Christian ideal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of self-abnegation and Nietzsche's philosophy
of self-fulfilment. In this particular section of
it Strauss is trying to suggest the dustiness,
mustiness, and inconclusiveness of "Science"
from the standpoint of the passions; this he
does by making a frightfully complicated
fugue from his main theme. How slyly does
he here satirize science! How to the life does
his fugue theme, starting off boldly in C major
and square-cut rhythm, and presently wandering
into chromatic harmonies and indecisive
triplets, symbolize the initial arrogance and
final futility of scholastic systems!</p>

<p>In the use of harmony for characterization
Strauss is no less skilful than in the more important
matters of melody and rhythm. The
essential quality of his harmony is perhaps
less "ultra-modern" than is sometimes supposed.
In spite of the sensational innovations
of "Salome" and "Elektra," he is so intensely
German in feeling and so well founded on the
German classics that the nucleus of his harmonic
system is the diatonic scale, simple and
rugged. One thinks of such powerful themes
as that of "Transfiguration" or the "Hero"
as the essential Strauss. Even "Salome" has
its Jochanaan, and the "Symphonia Domestica"
is surprisingly diatonic. Strauss is more
nearly related to the virile Wagner of "Die
Meistersinger" than to that other more sensuous
Wagner of "Tristan und Isolde." Of
course, there are wondrously expressive chromatic
passages in Strauss, as for instance the
"Grablied" in "Zarathustra"; but on the
whole his musical foundation is tonic-and-dominant,
like Mozart's, Beethoven's, and
Brahms's.</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p63.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>It is in the boldly imaginative and unconventional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
arrangement of simple material that
Strauss gets his most striking harmonic
effects. Plain "triads" and "dominant
sevenths," the small musical change of hack
composers, turn to gold in his hands. The
touchingly expressive cadence of Don Quixote's
theme will illustrate. The material is of the
most ordinary, yet the effect is magical
and its dramatic appropriateness surprising.
In the words of Mr. Arthur Kahn,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
"These confused harmonic windings through
which the central chords of the previously established
key are reached, characterize strikingly
the well-known tendency of Don Quixote
towards false conclusions. He goes carefully
out of the way of natural sequences and palpable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
facts, in order not to demolish therewith
his fancy structures."</p>

<p>Strauss has carried this principle of the close
juxtaposition of chords more or less foreign to
each other, and even of different keys, to greater
and greater lengths in his more recent works,
and to the effects of "queerness" which result
when these foreign tonal groups quickly
follow each other, and of more or less extreme
dissonance when they occur simultaneously,
he owes much of the violently adverse criticism
to which he has been subjected. Indeed,
nothing has more retarded his general
acceptance than these abrupt transitions and
unaccustomed discordancies. The matter is
of sufficient importance to intelligent appreciation
of him to justify a brief digression here.
For any composer who conceives music as a
number of melodies proceeding together in
greater or less amity, but preserving the measure
of independence that individuality and vigorous
movement demand&mdash;and Strauss is to
a peculiar degree such a polyphonic composer&mdash;a
certain amount of physical harshness at
moments when the melodies happen to clash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is not only unavoidable but positively desirable,
as tending to throw each into relief. According
to the degree of his experience the listener
follows the composer in this respect: that is,
he accepts with something more than passive
endurance, yes, with active pleasure, the
physically disagreeable clashes (dissonances)
which by setting off the differing contours of
the melodies emphasize for him their mental
and emotional appeal; but not&mdash;and the
point is of prime importance to the would-be
music-lover&mdash;not if he does not follow the
melodies, that is, not if he cannot hear consecutively
as well as moment by moment&mdash;for
it is only by following the threads, so to
speak, that we can untangle the knots. Accordingly
most untrained listeners dislike, probably,
music that contains many of these knots,
the presence of which makes it so interesting
and exciting to the experienced ear. The
woman who confessed to her piano teacher
that she did not like Bach's Two-part Inventions
because they were so "ugly" was not less
cultivated but only more frank than many who
have not discovered that Bach has to be heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"horizontally" (to borrow a figure from musical
notation) rather than "vertically."</p>

<p>This gift of horizontal hearing is peculiarly
necessary to anyone who would disentangle
the tonal knots in which Strauss delights,
working as he does with many more than two
voices and with the vast fund of harmonic
possibilities accumulated since Bach's day to
draw upon. And he is not the man to use his
resources timidly, or to make any concessions
to laziness or inexperience in his listeners.
Here is a reduction of a passage from "Ein
Heldenleben" to its essential elements.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The heavy brass gives the foundation harmonies;
the strings and woodwind have an
upward-moving melody, and the eight horns
blare forth at the same time a slower-moving
downward melody. If we read almost any
single chord vertically, we shall find it has its
measure of harshness, sometimes considerable.
If we listen to the coherent voices, none of
these dissonances will trouble us in the least.
This is a very simple example of what Strauss
is constantly doing in a far more complex way.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is a real difficulty in the way of Strauss
appreciation that while only familiarity can
enable us to follow the intricate windings
of the threads that make up his gorgeously
rich fabrics, frequent hearings of his later
and more complex symphonic poems are not
to be had, even in the large cities. In the meanwhile
we have no recourse but piano arrangements,
unsatisfactory for two reasons. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
first place, it is physically impossible to play
with two hands even a respectable fraction of
the melodies that Strauss delights to elaborate
for two hundred; and four-hand versions are
better only in degree, not in kind. Secondly,
piano versions fail us precisely in this matter
of unraveling dissonance, since by reducing a
colored pattern to monochrome they diminish
the salience of the lines we are trying to follow,
and by juxtaposing in one tone-quality tones
that in the orchestra are softened by difference
of timbre they notably increase the physical
harshness of the combinations. Obviously,
then, we must be exceedingly chary of condemning
Strauss, or any other composer, for
orchestral dissonance that we have either become
acquainted with insufficiently, or only
through piano arrangements.</p>

<p>After making these subtractions, however,
there undoubtedly remain many puzzling
clashes of tone in Strauss's scores, which
can be accounted for only as introduced
either for color or for dramatic expression.</p>

<p>The use of dissonance for the sake of color
enrichment is a familiar proceeding in modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
music, especially in that of impressionistic
type like Debussy's and Ravel's. Such use
is essentially decorative. To a more or
less clearly defined harmonic nucleus are
added softer tones, clashing with it, and
thus forming about it an aura or atmosphere
elsewhere compared to the mist which
softens the outlines of the landscape.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Strauss
is too fond of clear outlines and solid mass to
employ these impressionistic methods habitually,
or even frequently; but when he does,
it is with his usual skill and daring. The
theme of the silver rose in "Der Rosenkavalier"
is the inevitable example: the last pages of
the score are crowded with those silvery,
scarcely audible triads of celesta and flutes,
shifting and settling on the stronger G major
chord like snowflakes on a leaf (Figure VIII,
page 70).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p70.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Delicious as are these shimmerings, a use of
dissonance on the whole more characteristic of
the masculine nature of Strauss is the harsher,
more insistent juxtaposition of clashing tones
for the sake of their potency in the expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the tragic, the gruesome, or the abnormal.
Naturally this is pushed furthest in the treatment
of such pathological subjects as "Salome"
and "Elektra," where its effect is carefully
enhanced by contrast with strong or clear consonant
harmonies&mdash;"Salome" has its Jochanaan
and "Elektra" its Chrysothemis. The
close juxtaposition of foreign tone groups,
either successive or simultaneous, is carried to
great lengths in these operas. The theme of
the chattering Jews in "Salome" is an example
of the successive, as is the curious succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of the chords of F minor and B minor at Chrysothemis'
entrance in "Elektra."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The simultaneous kind was foreshadowed in
the famous ending of "Also Sprach Zarathustra,"
where the woodwind instruments sound
the chord of B major against the softly plucked
C of the strings; but we have to go to the
operas again to find it carried to its logical and
sometimes cruel extreme. There we find alien
triads marching uneasily together in double
harness;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> dominant sevenths similarly
shackled;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and strange passages in which
the upper parts move naturally, but above a
dislocated bass.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Such procedures, which, it
must always be remembered, because of differences
in tone quality between instruments
of different families, sound far less harsh in
the orchestra than on the piano, even if they
are no less queer musically, can theoretically be
carried to any extent. How far Strauss sometimes
carries them, a single example must suffice
to show.</p>

<p>Whether one "likes" such passages as this
or not is of course a question of taste. But
one thing at least is certain: it will not do
to charge Strauss with mere musical anarchy
in writing them&mdash;his work as a whole shows
too keen a sense of the traditional harmonic
values. That æsthetic insensibility, posing
as "freedom from rules," "independence," "liberalism,"
and the like, to which in the minds
of so many modern composers all keys are the
same, is happily not one of his failings. That
he has the keenest possible sense of the individual
qualities of the different keys, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the structural importance of their interrelationships,
each one of his long series of symphonic
poems has by its masterly design shown
afresh. How remarkable, for example, is the
antithesis of C, minor and major, and B,
minor and major, which is the constructive
principle of "Also Sprach Zarathustra!"
How interesting is the choice of F major for
the easy-going husband in the "Symphonia
Domestica," and of the keener, more brilliant
B major for the wife! And how this strong
tonal sense not only guides the design as a
whole, but suggests endless charming and
imaginative details! At the end of the lullaby,
in the same work, when the child has fallen
asleep and the music has sunk to a tranquil
G minor chord, this quietude is irradiated by
a flash of B major and three notes of the wife-theme,&mdash;the
loving tenderness of the waking
and watching mother over the sleeping infant.
Twice this happens, and each time the somnolent
G minor returns. Thus does genius
use tonality.</p>

<p>Being thus brought back to consider how
Strauss uses all the elements of music, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
this subtlest one of contrasting tonalities, in
the interest of characterization, we may ponder
with profit one final interpretation which
might seem over-ingenious had we not the
example of Mr. Klatte to spur our critical
imaginations. Why is it that we so seldom
hear the four tones of Till Eulenspiegel's main
theme on any other degrees of the scale than
A, F, B, C? Why is it that, in spite of the
constant movement from key to key of the
music, this theme is hardly ever carried also
into the new key?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Why does Strauss so insist
on this A, F, B, C, not only when the
music is in F major, but when, as at Till's
anger, it is in D minor, when, as in the procession
of the burghers, it is in A minor, and when,
just before the return of the main theme, it is
in C major? Why always A, F, B, C, whatever
the key? Is it not because Till, half-witted,
perverse, self-imprisoned, is not subject
to social influences, and remains unplastically
himself, whatever his environment? To transpose
a theme into the key prevailing at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
moment is to make order&mdash;but Till represents
disorder.... Such at least is the ingenious
explanation of a woman who understands
character as well as Strauss understands keys.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>All that we have been saying so far has concerned
itself primarily with Strauss's powers of
observation and characterization; we have
noted how broad a field of human character
he covers, and what varied artistic resources
he brings to its depiction; we have seen how
peculiarly fitted he is for this part of his work
by his active temperament, with its accompanying
intellectual alertness and freedom from
self-consciousness. But we saw that the great
dramatist needs not only observation but
sympathy, in order that his work may be as
moving as it is vivid; and in this power of
emotion we may at first be inclined to consider
Strauss deficient. There is undoubtedly a
popular superstition which puts him among
the intellectuals. The clean-cut efficiency of
his personality, his businesslike habits, his
mordant wit, both in words and in notes (was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
there ever anything so witty as "Till Eulenspiegel"?),
even questionably relevant details
like his exquisitely neat handwriting and his
well-groomed and not in the least long-haired
appearance,&mdash;all these create the impression
of a personality by no means <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schwärmerisch</i>,
far removed indeed from the rapt dreamer
who is the school-girl's ideal composer.</p>

<p>There is perhaps a measure of truth in this
picture. Many of Strauss's most characteristic
merits, as well as defects, may be traced
to his lack of the introspective tendency which
has been so fundamental in most of the other
great German musicians, from Bach to Wagner,
and which is seen perhaps at its purest
and best in Schumann. Strauss is at the
other pole from Schumann&mdash;and music is
wide! Mr. Ernest Newman, in the ablest
studies of Strauss yet published in English,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
points to the internal evidence of this lack in
his earliest and therefore least sophisticated
compositions. "The general impression one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
gets from all these works," writes Mr. Newman,
"is that of a head full to overflowing with
music, a temperament that is energetic and
forthright rather than warm ..., and a general
lack not only of young mannish sentimentality,
but of sentiment. There is often a
good deal of ardour in the writing, but it is
the ardour of the intellect rather than of the
emotions." And again: "Wherever the
youthful Strauss has to sing rather than declaim,
when he has to be emotional rather
than intellectual, as in his slow movements, he
almost invariably fails.... He feels it hard
to squeeze a tear out of his unclouded young
eyes, to make those taut, whip-cord young
nerves of his quiver with emotion."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Now, although Mr. Newman would not accept
his own description of Strauss the youth
as a fair account of the mature composer,
although, indeed, he specifically insists, in a
later passage, that Strauss's musical imagination
lost, at adolescence, its "first metallic
hardness" and "softened into something more
purely emotional," yet his vivid phrases seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
give us a picture of Strauss that is in essentials
as true at fifty as it was at fifteen. "A temperament
that is energetic and forthright rather
than warm," "an ardour of the intellect rather
than of the emotions"&mdash;these are surely still
Straussian characteristics. And what is more
they are characteristics that, whatever their
dangers, have exerted a splendid influence in
modern music. Schumann's was a noble introspection
that no one who knows it can help
loving; but in natures less pure the introspective
habit of German romanticism has not
always been so happy in its effects. An unhealthy
degree of self-contemplation tends to
substitute futile or morbid imaginings for the
solid realities of life; the over-introspective
artist cuts himself off from a large arc of experience
and is prone to exaggerate the importance
of the more intimate sentiments, and
when, as in German romanticism, such a tendency
is widespread, a whole school may become
febrile and erotic. The vapors of such
confirmed sentimentalism can best be dispersed
by a ray of clear, cold intelligence, such
as Shaw plays through contemporary literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and Strauss through contemporary music.
"Cynicism," says Stevenson, "is the cold
tub and bath towel of the emotions, and absolutely
necessary to life in cases of advanced
sensibility." Strauss has administered this
tonic shock to us, immersed as we were in the
languors of the Wagnerian boudoir. He has
rooted us out of our agreeable reveries, sent
us packing outdoors, and made us gasp with
the stinging impacts of crude existence and the
tingling lungfuls of fresh air. Is it not worth
while, for this vigorous life, to sacrifice a few
subtle nuances of feeling?</p>

<p>If then we so emphasize his possession of
the active rather than the contemplative temperament,
it is not to blame him for not being
a Schumann, but to render as precise as possible
in our own minds the notion of what it
is to be a Strauss. If there is a point where
blame or regret must mingle with our appreciation,
it will be likely to come not at the preliminary
determination of what his temperament
is, but at the further discovery of certain extremes
to which he has allowed his interest in
externals to carry him, especially in his later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
work. And here we must try to set right a
misconception with which Mr. Newman leaves
the student of his essay on "Program Music."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mr. Newman, wishing to draw a reasoned
distinction between self-sufficing, or "pure,"
or "abstract" music&mdash;that is, music that
makes its appeal directly and without the aid
of any verbal tag&mdash;and "poetic" music, or,
more specifically, music with a definite program
or title, adopts, seemingly without criticism,
the popular notion that the first is less
"emotional" than the second, and supports
it by piling up epithets which beg the very
question he is supposed to be examining. It
is easy to "damn a dog by giving him a bad
name," and it is easy to make music without
program seem a dry and academic affair by
calling it "abstract note-spinning," "mathematical
music," "mere formal harmony," "embroidery,"
"juggling," "the arousing of pleasure
in beautiful forms"&mdash;much too easy for a
man of Mr. Newman's penetration and fair-mindedness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>One expects this kind of thing
from inexperienced youths whose enthusiasm
has been inflamed by the gorgeous color and
the easily grasped "story" of such a work as,
let us say, Tschaikowsky's "Romeo and Juliet,"
who have not had time to live themselves
into accord with the profound emotional life
of the great musical classics such as Bach's
fugues and Beethoven's symphonies; but from
Mr. Newman such superficialities, especially
when they are associated, as these are, with
many penetrating and true observations, and
an argument in the main convincing, come as
a surprise.</p>

<p>The central fallacy that vitiates Mr. Newman's
conclusions lurks in his assumption that
"specific reference to actual life" necessarily
means greater emotion, and that the generality
or "abstractness" of classic music is a symptom
of emotional deficiency. "In the old
symphony or sonata," says Mr. Newman, "a
succession of notes, pleasing in itself but not
having specific reference to actual life&mdash;not attempting,
that is, to get at very close quarters
with strong emotional or dramatic expression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
but influencing and affecting us mainly by reason
of its purely formal relations and by the purely
physical pleasure inherent in it as sound&mdash;was
stated, varied, worked out, and combined with
other themes of the same order...." And
again: "The opening phrase of Beethoven's
8th Symphony refers to nothing at all external
to itself; it is what Herbert Spencer has called
the music of pure exhilaration; to appreciate
it you have to think of nothing but itself; the
pleasure lies primarily in the way the notes
are put together." To this a footnote is appended:
"There is emotion, of course, at the
back of the notes; the reader will not take me
to mean that the pleasure is merely physical,
like a taste or an odour. But the emotive wave
is relatively small and very vague; it neither
comes directly from nor suggests any external
existence." Once more, the assumption that
degree of emotion is in a direct ratio with externality
of suggestion.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact is not the exact opposite
the truth? Are we not most deeply
moved when we are lifted clean out of the
concrete and carried up to the universal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
which it is only an example? Is not the general
far more moving than the particular? Do we
not feel external details to be irrelevant and
even annoyingly intrusive when we are stirred
to the recognition of inward truths, of spiritual
realities? No doubt program music owes to
its reference to the particular story, the well-known
hero, the familiar book or picture, a
certain vividness, an immediateness of appeal
even to the unmusical, a rich fund of associations
to draw upon; but even program music,
surely, tends in all its more powerful moments
to penetrate below this comparatively
superficial layer of external facts to the profounder
(and of course vaguer) emotional
strata of which they are, so to speak, the outcroppings.
It is odd how little difference there
is between program music and music, without
the tag, in their more inspired moments; in
all symphonic poems it is the symphonic rather
than the poetic element that is chiefly responsible
for the effect produced; and indeed, increasingly
realistic as Strauss has become in
his later works, even here the memorable moments
are those of emotional fulfilment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
realization, in which we tacitly agree to let
the program go hang. Far from the "emotive
wave" being proportional to the suggestion
of "external existence," then, one would say
that it was rather proportional to the realization
of universal spiritual truth, and that in
systematically confronting us with ever more
and more crassly external existences Strauss
has in his later works followed a practice as
questionable as the theory which supports it,
and levied an ever greater tax of boredom on
our joy in the finer moments of his art.</p>

<p>Even in "Tod und Verklärung," which
remains to this day, in the words of M. Romain
Rolland,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> "one of the most moving works of
Strauss, and that which is constructed with
the noblest unity," the repulsively realistic
details with which the gasping for breath of
the dying man is pictured consort but incongruously
with the tender beauty of the "childhood"
passages and the broad grandeur of the
"transfiguration." The love of crass realism
thus early revealed has grown apace, by even
steps, unfortunately, with the extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
powers upon which it is parasitic. In the
works conceived partially in a spirit of comedy,
to be sure, such as "Till Eulenspiegel" and
"Don Quixote," it finds a whimsical, witty
expression for itself which not only seldom
strikes a false note, but is often exceedingly
amusing. Till's charge among the market-women's
pots and pans, the bleating of the
sheep in "Don Quixote," even perhaps the
baby's squalling in the "Symphonia Domestica,"
are clever bits of side play, like
the "business" of an irrepressible comedian,
which are not out of key with the main substance
of the music. But even here these
realistic touches are exuberances, and inessential;
the essential thing in "Till," for example,
is the spirit of mischief and destruction
that existed in the human heart for centuries
before the rascal Eulenspiegel was born, and
that respond in us to his pranks; and this
essence Strauss expresses in the purely musical
parts of his work, and by means identical in kind
with those employed in a Beethoven scherzo.</p>

<p>And if realistic detail is in such instances
subordinate to musical expression it may in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the treatment of more serious subjects become
positively inimical to it. Do we really care
very much about supermen and "convalescents"
and the rival claims of Christianity and
neo-paganism when we are listening to "Also
Sprach Zarathustra"? Does not that everlasting
C-G-C, with its insistence on an esoteric
meaning that we never knew or have
forgotten, pester us unnecessarily? What we
remember in "Zarathustra" is much more
likely to be the poignant passion of the "Grablied,"
or the beautiful broad melody of the
violins, in B major, near the end, which bears
no label at all save the tempo mark "Langsam."
Similarly, in the "Symphonia Domestica"
the family squabbles, growling father
giving the réplique to bawling infant, leave us
skeptically detached or mildly amused. It is
the musical charm of the "easy-going" parts
in F major, the cradle song, above all the
largely conceived slow movement with its
wonderful development of the husband's
"dreamy" theme, that really stir us. As for
"Ein Heldenleben," what an unmitigated bore
are those everlasting Adversaries!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus in the later works Strauss's shortcomings
on the subjective side, his native tendency
to concern himself more with concrete appearances
than with essential emotional truths,
seem exaggerated to such a degree as seriously
to disturb the balance of his art. As he has
interested himself more and more in externals
he has not entirely evaded the danger of exalting
the "program" at the expense of the "music,"
and his work, for all its extraordinary brilliance,
its virtuosity, its power, has become over-emphatic,
ill-balanced, hard in finish and theatrical
in emphasis. It is ultimately a spiritual defect
that compels us to withhold our full admiration
from "Ein Heldenleben" or the "Domestica."
We admit their titanic power, their marvelous
nervous vitality; their technical temerities
grow for the most part acceptable with familiarity;
it is their emotional unreality that
disappoints us. This charge of unreality, made
against realism, may surprise us, may seem to
savor of paradox; but it is inevitable. For
music, as we have been told <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad nauseam</i>, but
as we must never be allowed to forget, exists
to express feeling; the only truth essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to it is truth to emotion; and therefore realism,
looking as it does away from inward emotion
to external fact, ever tends toward musical
unreality.</p>

<p>How shall we account for this progressive
externalizing of Strauss's musical interest?
Is it all temperament? Has environment had
anything to do with it? Do those high-sounding
but dubious things "modern German materialism"
and its accompanying æsthetic "decadence"
bear in any way upon the matter?
These are questions too large for a humble
annalist of music to answer. M. Romain Rolland,
however, in his essay on French and
German Music in "Musiciens d'aujourd'hui,"
has one suggestion too relevant to be neglected
here. "German music," says M. Rolland,
"loses from day to day its intimateness: there
is some of it still in Wolf, thanks to the exceptional
misfortunes of his life; there is
very little of it in Mahler, despite his efforts
to concentrate himself upon himself; there is
hardly any of it in Strauss, although he is the
most interesting of the three. They no longer
have any depth. I have said that I attribute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
this fact to the detestable influence of the
theatre, to which almost all these artists are
attached, as Kapellmeisters, directors of opera,
etc. They owe to it the often melodramatic
or at least external character of their music&mdash;music
on parade, thinking constantly of effect."</p>

<p>One hesitates to accept so damning a charge
as this against any artist, especially against a
musical artist, who above all others should
render sincere account of what is in his own
heart rather than "give the public what it
wants." Yet there is only too much in the
later Strauss that it explains. How else shall
we account for the exaggerated emphasis, the
over-elaboration of contrasts that seem at
times almost mechanical, and that suggest
shrewd calculation of the crowd psychology
rather than free development of the musical
thought? What else explains so well the sensational
elements so incredibly childish in an
art so mature as Strauss's: the ever-increasing
noisiness, the introduction of wind-machines,
thunder-machines, and heaven knows what
diabolic engines; the appetite for novelty for
novelty's sake? And is there not a reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the "saponaceous influences of opera," as
Sir Hubert Parry so well calls them, in the
cloying over-sweetness, the sensuous luxury, of
those peculiar passages, like the oboe solo in
"Don Juan," the love music in "Ein Heldenleben,"
which form such conventional spots
in the otherwise vital tissue of the music?
Surely the opera house, and not the concert
hall, is the place where such sybaritisms naturally
breed.</p>

<p>For one reason and another, then&mdash;temperament,
environment, the enervation of the
operatic atmosphere with its constant quest of
"effect"&mdash;the fresh and vital elements in
Strauss's art have not entirely escaped contamination
by more stale, conventional, and
specious ones. Particularly has he failed of his
highest achievement when desire for immediate
appeal, the bias of an over-active mind, or the
fallacies of a one-sided æsthetic have led him
too far from the subjective emotion which is
truly the soul of music. Yet when all subtractions
are made he must remain one of the great
creative musicians of his day. His surprising
vigor and trenchancy of mind, his wit, his sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of comedy (in the Meredithian use of the word),
his unerring eye for character, and, at his best,
his sympathetic interpretation of life and his
broad grasp of its significance as a whole, combine
to produce a unique personality. Some
of the eloquence we find in the more pompous
parts of "Zarathustra" or "Ein Heldenleben"
posterity will probably dismiss as bombast;
but posterity will be stupid indeed if it does
not prize "Till Eulenspiegel" and "Don
Quixote" as master expressions of the spirit
of comedy in music. "Till Eulenspiegel"
particularly is a well-nigh perfect blending of
the three qualities of the master dramatist we
began by discussing. It combines the observation
of a Swift with the sympathetic imagination
of a Thackeray. Beneath its turbulent
surface of fun is a deep sense of pathos,
of the fragmentariness and fleetingness of Till,
for all his pranks; so that to the sensitive it
may easily bring tears as well as smiles. Above
all, it has that largeness of vision, rarest of
artistic qualities, which not only penetrates
from appearance to feeling, but grasps feeling
in all its relations, presents a unified picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of life, and purges the emotions as the Greek
tragedy aimed to do. All is suffused in beauty.
The prologue: "Once upon a time there was a
man," and the epilogue: "Thus it happened
to Till Eulenspiegel," make a complete cycle
of the work, and remove its expression to a
philosophic or poetic plane high above mere
crude realism. There are doubtless more impressive
single passages in later works, but
it may be doubted if anything Strauss has
ever written is more perfect or more tender
than this wittiest of pieces, in which the wit
is yet forgotten in the beauty.</p>

<h2>III<br />
<br />
<small>SIR EDWARD ELGAR</small></h2>


<p>The most inspiring chapters of
musical history are those that
tell of the struggles of great men,
spurred by the desire for free,
sincere, and personal speech, to
wrest the musical language out of the triteness
long conventional usage has given it; to make it
say something new; to add, so to speak, to the
impersonal organ chord it sounds an overtone
of their particular human voices. This is
what stirs us when we think of Beethoven,
after he had written two symphonies in the
style of Haydn and Mozart, finding himself
at the opening of "a new road," leading he
knew not whither, but irresistibly summoning
him; of Gluck, at fifty, protesting against the
hollowness of the Italian operas he had been
writing up to that time; of Franck, still older,
finding at last the secret of that vague, groping,
mystical harmonic style he made so peculiarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
his own. Men dread liberty, says Bernard
Shaw, because of the bewildering responsibility
it imposes and the uncommon alertness it demands;
no wonder that they acclaim as truly
great only those artists who fully accept this
responsibility and successfully display this
alertness. And it may be suggested that the
more conventional, and therefore paralyzing
to personal initiative, the style from which the
artist takes his departure, the more alertness
does he require, and the more credit does he
deserve if he arrives at freedom. If this be
true, Sir Edward Elgar, who, starting at English
oratorio, has arrived at the cosmopolitan
yet completely individual musical speech of
the first Symphony, the Variations, and parts
of "The Dream of Gerontius," is surely one
of the great men of our time.</p>

<p>For nothing, not even stark crudity, is so unfavorable
to artistic life as the domination by
a conventional formalism like that of the
Handel-Mendelssohn school from which Elgar
had to start. It may take a great artist like
Dvo&#345;ák or Verdi to build an art on the naïvetés
of Bohemian folk-song or the banalities of Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
opera; but to free an art from the tyranny
of drowsy custom, as Elgar has done, requires
not only a great artist, but something of a
revolutionary.</p>

<p>Elgar is English in character, but cosmopolitan
in sympathies, style, and workmanship.
In other words, while retaining the personal
and racial quality natural to all sincere art, he
has been magnanimous, intelligent, and unconventional
enough to break through the
charmed circle of insularity which has kept so
many English composers from vital contact
with the world. Such insularity cannot but
be fatal to art. It is bad enough when it confines
the artist to narrow native models. It is
even worse when, ignoring native music of the
finest quality, such as that of Purcell, it follows
blindly, through timidity or inertia, traditions
imported by foreigners of inferior grade. Generations
of English musicians have stultified
themselves in imitating Handel's burly ponderousness
and Mendelssohn's somewhat vapid
elegance. They have turned a deaf ear, not
only to the greater contemporaries of these idols&mdash;to
Bach and to Schumann&mdash;but also to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
more modern thought of Wagner, Franck,
Tschaikowsky, and Brahms. They have been
correct and respectable in an art which lives
only through intense personal emotion. They
have narrowed their sympathies. They have
been national in an age of dawning internationalism.</p>

<p>Elgar, on the contrary, together with a few
others whose work deserves to be better known
than it is, has had the courage to aspire to a
cosmopolitan breadth of style. He has made
up for the lack of what are called "educational
advantages" by something far more valuable&mdash;an
insatiable intellectual curiosity. Self-taught
except for a few violin lessons in youth,
he has been all his life a tireless listener, observer,
and student. When he was a boy,
having no text-books on musical form, he wrote
a whole symphony in imitation of Mozart's
in G minor, "following the leader" with admirable
and fruitful docility. As a youth he
would play violin, at the last desk oftentimes,
in any orchestra to which he could gain admission,
for the sake of the experience; and between
rehearsals would laboriously collate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
instrumental parts to find out why a certain
passage sounded well or ill. He would travel
two hundred and fifty miles to London, from
his home in Worcester, to hear a Crystal
Palace Saturday concert, returning late at
night. Knowing well that any potent individuality
like his own grows by what it assimilates,
he has had none of the small man's
fear of injuring by the study of others his
"individuality." The internal evidence of his
works shows that there are few modern scores
he has left unpondered; yet no living composer
has a more unmistakably personal style than
his.</p>

<p>His intellectual activity has by no means
confined itself to music. He has always been
an omnivorous reader. And while much of
this reading naturally proceeded in desultory
fashion, for the sake of relaxation, and took
him sometimes as far afield as Froissart, the
fourteenth-century French chronicler, as suggested
by his early overture of that name, he
has never lost the power of concentration, and
can study a book to as good purpose as a score.
His analytic notes to his symphonic study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
"Falstaff" (1913) reveal a surprisingly detailed
knowledge both of Shakespeare and of
Shakespeare's commentators. Science also
interests him, and for some years his hobby
was scientific kite-flying. He is of the nervously
irritable temperament so often coupled
with mental alertness, walks about restlessly
while conversing, and detests all routine work
like teaching. "To teach the right pupil was
a pleasure," he once said, "but teaching in
general was to me like turning a grindstone
with a dislocated shoulder." In 1889 he
married, gave up most of his teaching, and
moved to London. Since then he has lived
partly among his native Malvern Hills, partly
near London, but has devoted himself almost
entirely to composing and conducting.</p>

<p>Elgar's whole life has thus been a gradual
and progressive self-emancipation from the
limitations of inherited style, an escape from
habit to initiative, from formality to eloquence,
from insularity to cosmopolitanism. Nor has
this progress been the less inspiring in that it
has been spasmodic, subject to interruptions,
and never complete. In that respect it shares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the lovable imperfection of all things human.
It has been instinctive rather than reasoned,
has proceeded largely by trial and error, and
has counted among its experiments almost as
many failures as successes. There are commonplace
pages in almost everything Elgar
has written, unless it be the "Enigma" Variations.
But the important point is that however
much, in moments of technical inattention
or emotional indifference, he may fall back into
the formulæ of his school, he has at his best
left them far behind, and made himself the
peer of his greatest continental contemporaries
in wealth and variety of expression&mdash;of such
men as Strauss in Germany and d'Indy in
France.</p>

<p>What are these never-quite-ejected formulæ,
lurking in Elgar's brain, ever ready to guide
his pen when for a moment he forgets to think
and feel? If we look at the opening chorus
of "The Black Knight," written in 1893, and
numbered opus 25, we shall get a working notion
of them (Figure X, page 102).</p>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p102.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>How this passage calls up the atmosphere
of the typical English choral festival: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
unwieldy masses of singers, the scarcely less
unwieldy orchestra or organ, the ponderous
movement of the music, half majestic, half
tottering, as of a drunken elephant, the well-meaning
ineptitude of the expression, highly
charged with good nature but innocent of
nuance! There is the solid diatonic harmony,
conscientiously divided between the four
equally industrious parts. There is the thin
disguising of the tendency of this hymn-tune
type of harmony to sit down, so to speak, on
the accent of each measure, by a few conventional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
suspensions. There is the attempt
to give the essentially stagnant melody a
specious air of busyness by putting in a triplet
here and a dot or short rest there. And there
is the sing-song phraseology by which a phrase
of four measures follows a phrase of four
measures as the night the day. In short, there
is the perfectly respectable production of music
by the yard, on the most approved pattern,
undistorted by a breath of personal feeling or
imagination.</p>

<p>How far Elgar, whenever his imagination is
stirred, can get away from this conventional
vacuity, even without departing materially
from its general idiom, may as well be shown
at once, for the sake of the illuminating contrast,
by the quotation of a bit of genuine
Elgar&mdash;the "Nimrod" in the "Enigma" Variations,
opus 36 (1899).</p>

<p>This touching tribute to a friend of the composer,
Mr. A. J. Jaeger (the English equivalent
of whose name, hunter, suggested the title),
has all the serious thoughtfulness, the tenderness
coupled with aspiration, the noble plainness,
that belong to Elgar at his best. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
it is a striking fact that the originality of the
passage (for no one but Elgar could have
written it) is due to subtle, almost unanalyzable
qualities in the mode of composition rather
than to any unusual features of style. The
harmonic style, indeed, is quite the same simple
diatonic one as that of "The Black Knight"
chorus, showing that, in music as in literature,
noble poetry can be made from the same materials
as doggerel. There is the same predominance
of simple triads and seventh chords,
especially the more rugged sevenths, for which
Elgar has a noticeable fondness; the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
frequent use of suspensions, though here it is
dictated by emotion rather than by custom;
the same restless motion of the bass, one of the
hall-marks of Elgar's style. The melody, however,
shows a tendency to large leaps, often
of a seventh, in alternating directions, giving
its line a sharply serrated profile. This, it
may be noted, is also one of the outstanding
features of his more personal thought. But
above all should be observed the rhythmic
flexibility that here takes the place of sing-song&mdash;the
free sweep of the line, scorning to
rest on the accents, soaring through its long
continuous flight like a bird in a favoring gale.</p>

<p>We have here, then, the vein of expression
at once plain, serious, and noble, which makes
Elgar at his best both English and universal.
It recurs frequently throughout the whole body
of his work: in the "Go forth" chorus in
"Gerontius," so finely used in the prelude;
in the theme of the Variations; in the fundamental
theme of the first Symphony, which
dominates the entire work and in which
Elgar reaches perhaps his most exalted utterance;
in the themes of the slow movement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the same symphony; and in another way in
the Prince Hal theme of "Falstaff." Some
may feel that this is the essential Elgar. Yet
there is also in this quiet Englishman a passionate
mysticism, a sense of subtle spiritual
experience, which has urged him to develop
progressively quite another mode of musical
speech. On this side he is related to Wagner
and to César Franck. Like them he has
realized that there is a whole range of feeling,
inaccessible to the diatonic system of harmony,
that can be suggested by harmony
based on the chromatic scale, and even more
vividly and subtly by a harmonic system that
opens up a path between all the keys, that
makes them all available together&mdash;by what
we may call, in short, "polytonal" harmony.
This polytonal harmonic system is common
to "Tristan und Isolde," to Franck's "Les
Béatitudes," to much of Chopin, and to many
parts of "The Dream of Gerontius," however
much they may differ in other respects.</p>

<p>Elgar began early to experiment in this
direction. Even in "The Black Knight," for
example, at the word "rock" in the lines</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>we have the following progression, equally
striking from the musical and the dramatic
point of view:</p>

<p>This is what Mr. Carl W. Grimm has well
named a "modulating sequence"; that is,
each unit group of harmony (in this case a
measure in length) is the sequential repetition
of the preceding, yet the chromatic texture is
so managed that each begins in a new key;
the total effect is thus much more novel and
exciting than is that of the traditional monotonal
sequence. Yet, as Mr. Stillman-Kelley
has pointed out in a closely reasoned essay,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
however ingenious may be the arrangement of
the modulating sequence on the harmonic side,
it is liable to the same fault that besets the
monotonal sequence&mdash;that is, rhythmic monotony.
Once we have the pattern, we know
what to expect; and if the composer gives us
exactly what we expect the effect is too obvious,
and we are bored. It is precisely by his avoidance
of this literal repetition, says Mr. Kelley,
that Wagner, in such a modulating sequence as
that of the Pilgrims' Chorus, maintains both
the rhythmic and the harmonic vitality of the
music.</p>

<p>Judged by the standard thus suggested, the
sequence on the word "rock" is seen to be too
literally carried out. The pattern is applied
with the mechanical regularity of a stencil,
necessarily with an equally mechanical result.
It must be said in the interest of just criticism
that Elgar frequently falls into this fault.
Even Gerontius' cry of despair, so magnificently
developed by the orchestra, contains less of
subtle variety than is given to that curiously
similar cry of Amfortas in "Parsifal" by the
"inversion" of the parts, while the priest's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
adjuration to his departing soul<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the
chorus afterward based on it, become irritatingly
monotonous through the literal repetition
of a pattern admirable in itself. At the beginning
of the Development in the first movement
of the second Symphony there is a passage
illustrating the same fault. The tonal and
harmonic coloring here are singularly impressive,
and quite original; as Mr. Ernest Newman
remarks in his analysis:<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> "A new and
less sunny cast has come over the old themes....
The harmonies have grown more mysterious;
the scoring is more veiled; the dynamics
are all on a lower scale." Everything
favors, in fact, a most impressive effect except
the structure; but that, through its over-literal
application of the modulating sequence,
almost jeopardizes the whole.</p>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p110.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, however, happier applications
of this harmonically so fruitful device are not
far to seek in Elgar's scores, especially the
later ones. The following theme from "The
Apostles," appropriately marked "mistico," is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a fine example of the kind of mysticism that
is not unmindful of the needs of the body and
of the intelligence as well as of the soul.
The principle is still that of the modulating
sequence, but the application is here not mechanical
but freely imaginative. Two of the
one-measure units are in each phrase balanced
by a unit twice as long, so that the rhythm
is as a whole far more organic than in our
earlier examples of sequences. Furthermore
the purely harmonic treatment makes use of unforeseeable
relations, so that the effect of stereotype
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is successfully evaded. Finally, here is
a theme from the second symphony in which
the sequential principle is still further veiled,
so far as harmony is concerned. The harmonic
progressions seem here to "shoot," so
to speak, with complete spontaneity; we cannot
anticipate whither the next move will take
us, and we get constantly to interesting new
places; yet the unity of the whole, beginning
and ending in E-flat<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, prevents any sense of
aimless wandering.</p>

<p>The alert student will probably still feel,
nevertheless, perhaps without being able to
account in any way for his impression, that
even in these last excerpts there is an unsatisfactory
element, a something that keeps them
on a lower level of art, for all their opaline
color, than that of the forthright and transparent
"Nimrod." This something, perhaps
on the whole Elgar's most ineradicable fault,
is rhythmical "short breath." He gets away
from it, to be sure, in all his finest pages; but
except when his imagination is deeply stirred
his melodic line shows the dangerous tendency
to fall into short segments, a measure or two
in length, into a configuration of scallops, so
to speak, rather than wide sweeps, exemplified
in the three last illustrations. Instead of
flying, it hops. Examples will be found right
through his works, from the second theme of
the early overture "Froissart" to that of the
first movement of the Violin Concerto, opus 61.</p>

<p>This kind of sing-songiness is as fatal to noble
rhythm in music as it is in poetry&mdash;in much
of Longfellow, for example; and the frequency
with which Elgar relapses into it suggests that
he has some of the same fatal facility, the
tendency to talk without thinking, which so
often kept the American poet below his best.
The parallel might be carried out, if it were
worth while, in some detail. Both men wrote
too much, and both are "popular" in the bad
sense as well as the good. The "Pomp and
Circumstance" Marches are saved, despite
the frequent triteness of their melody, by their
buoyant high spirits; but of the vapid and
sentimental "Salut d'Amour," which has sold
in the thousands and been arranged for all
possible combinations of instruments, including
two mandolins and a guitar, the less said
the better. Yet it is noteworthy that the
very tendency to an over-obvious, monotonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
rhythmic scheme which works for the popularity
of a small piece with the thoughtless
and trivial-minded, works against it in the case
of a larger composition which appeals to the
musically serious, and wins its way gradually
at best. Thus Elgar's second symphony, which
suffers much more from this besetting fault
than the first, has been less popular for that
very reason. Statistics are significant in such
cases. The second symphony was played
twenty-seven times before it was three years
old, a considerable number for so serious
a work<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; but the first, called by Nikisch
"Brahms's Fifth," a compliment which could
be paid to few other modern symphonies without
absurdity, achieved the almost incredible
record of eighty-two performances in its first
year, in such widely scattered places as London,
Vienna, Berlin, Leipsic, Bonn, St. Petersburg,
Buda-Pest, Toronto, Sydney, and the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Of course it is not intended to account for
the wide favor accorded this symphony by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
adducing so technical a matter, from one point
of view, as its comparative freedom from a
rhythmic weakness to which its composer is unfortunately
peculiarly subject. What is meant
is simply that sing-song balance of short phrases
is often a symptom of superficial feeling, and
that, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">per contra</i>, elastic, vigorous, and imaginative
rhythms are a constant result, and
therefore a reliable evidence, of the emotional
ardor that makes a piece of music live. The
A-flat Symphony is a work intensely felt by
the composer, a work that, coming from his
heart, finds its way to the hearts of others.
And in this respect, in its emotional sincerity,
earnestness, and subjectivity, it differs from
his other works more in degree than in kind.
For in everything Elgar writes there is the
preoccupation with inner feeling which we find
in such a composer as Schumann, but from
which most of our contemporaries have turned
away. Elgar is an introspective musician, not an
externally observant tone-painter like Strauss.
It is noteworthy how completely his treatment
of death, for example, in "The Dream of
Gerontius," differs from that of Strauss in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
"Tod und Verklärung." By no means accidental
is it, but highly significant of the opposed
attitudes of the two artists, that while
Strauss emphasizes the external picture&mdash;the
panting breath, the choking cries&mdash;Elgar
penetrates to the inward emotional state. He
has written surprisingly little program music.
Aside from a few realistic touches scattered
through the choral works, and the delicate
little vignette of the friend at sea in the
"Enigma" Variations, there is only "Falstaff"&mdash;and
that deals more with character than
with picture. In this respect Elgar deserves
well of his contemporaries for standing against
a popular but dangerous tendency to externalize
the most inward of the arts, and for showing
that even in the twentieth century the spiritual
drama set forth in a work of pure music, like
his first symphony, can be as thrilling as those
that have made immortal Beethoven's later
quartets and sonatas.</p>

<p>That this attitude indicates a preference
rather than a limitation is proved by the
felicity of the external characterization in
passages scattered all through the choral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
works, as for instance the setting of the line
"The castle 'gan to rock," cited above, from
the "Black Knight," the music of the devils
in "Gerontius," or the scene in "The Apostles"
where Peter walks upon the water, and even
more strikingly in "Falstaff," the composer's
single contribution to program music. Here
he frankly takes the Straussian attitude, and
skilfully uses the Straussian methods. Leading
themes, as he tells us in his analysis,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> depict
the fat knight, one "in a green old age, mellow,
frank, gay, easy, corpulent, loose, unprincipled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and luxurious" (<em>a</em>); another "cajoling and
persuasive" (<em>b</em>); and a third in his mood of
"boastfulness and colossal mendacity" (<em>c</em>).</p>

<p>These portraits evidently belong to the same
gallery as Strauss's Don Quixote, Sancho
Panza (<em>cf.</em> the first quotation), Till Eulenspiegel,
and others; they are sketched in the
same suggestive and telling lines; in the third
there is even the same touch of caricature.
The picture of Eastcheap, too, where, "among
ostlers and carriers, and drawers, and merchants,
and pilgrims and loud robustious women, Falstaff
has freedom and frolic," has something of
the German composer's brilliant externality.
It should, as Elgar says in his notes, and it
does, "chatter, blaze, glitter, and coruscate."
Yet, vivid as all this is, even here from time to
time, notably in the two "interludes," the
composer characteristically withdraws from
the turbulent outer world he has conjured up,
to brood upon its spiritual meaning; and it is
noteworthy that after stating in his analysis
that "some lines quoted from the plays are
occasionally placed under the themes to indicate
the feeling to be conveyed by the music,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
he immediately adds, "but it is not intended
that the meaning of the music, often varied
and intensified, shall be narrowed to a corollary
of these quotations only." This intensification
arises, of course, through the universalizing
of all the particulars by the power of music to
express pure emotion.</p>

<p>The same instinctive leaning to introspection
is curiously shown in the Enigma Variations.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
"I have in the Variations," writes
Elgar in a private letter, "sketched portraits
of my friends&mdash;a new idea, I think&mdash;that is,
in each variation I have looked at the theme
through the personality (as it were) of another
Johnny." The idea was not indeed quite
new, however originally applied, as Schumann
had already sketched a number of his friends in
the "Carnaval." But what is of much greater
import is that Schumann and Elgar, both
introspective temperaments, go about this business
of portrait painting in the same characteristic
way&mdash;not by recording the external
aspects of these "other Johnnies," but by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sympathetically putting themselves at their
points of view and becoming, so to speak, the
spokesmen of their souls. The tender intimateness
of Elgar's interpretations is their supreme
charm. Whatever the character portrayed,
whether the tender grace of C. A. E. (Lady
Elgar), the caprice of H. D. S-P., the virile
energy of W. M. B., the gossamer delicacy of
Dorabelle, or the nobility of "Nimrod," we
feel in each case that we have for the moment
really got inside the personality, and looked
at the world along that unique perspective.
Even in the indescribably lovely Romanza,
Variation XIII, calling up the thought of a
friend at sea, though programistic devices are
used, the spirit looks away from externalities.
Violas in a quietly undulating rhythm suggest
the ocean expanse; an almost inaudible tremolo
of the drum gives us the soft throb of the
engines; a quotation from Mendelssohn's
"Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage," in the
dreamy tones of the clarinet, completes the
story. Yet "story" it is not&mdash;and there is
the subtlety of it. Dim sea and dream-like
steamer are only accessories after all. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thought of the distant friend, the human soul
there, is what gently disengages itself as the
essence of the music.</p>

<p>In his two symphonies the composer gives
us even less encouragement to search for detailed
programs. It is true that the second
bears the motto from Shelley:</p>

<p class="left" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 2em; font-size: 0.95em; " >
Rarely, rarely, comest thou,<br />
Spirit of Delight.<br />
</p>

<p>But it will be observed, first, that these lines
contain no pictorial images which would prevent
their application to the most purely
emotional music&mdash;a symphony of Beethoven,
for example; and second, that even their
emotional bearing is somewhat ambiguous, as
we are left in doubt whether it is the Spirit
of Delight itself, or the rareness of its visitations,
that we are asked to consider. Mr.
Ernest Newman thinks the former, and finds
in the symphony the "jocundity and sweetness"
which characterize English music from
the earliest times. We read in the Musical
Times,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> however, that there is "some disagreement
... with the composer's own opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that it is on a totally different psychological
plane from that of the first symphony, and
represents a more serene mood," although the
writer adds that "it is unquestionable that the
themes, even in the slow movement, speak of
a lighter heart and more tranquil emotions."
If there is thus room for doubt even as to the
emotional content of the work, no attempt to
read into it a "story" is likely to be successful.
Even Mr. Newman, programist <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à outrance</i>,
is forced in this case to the admission that
"though practically every musical work of
any emotional value must start from this basis
[of the composer's life-experience],<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the connection
of it with the external world or with the
symbols of the literary and plastic arts may
range through many degrees of vagueness or
precision, according to the psychological build
of the composer."</p>

<p>Coming now at last to Elgar's masterpiece,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the Symphony<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
in A-flat, No. 1, opus 55, first
performed under Dr. Hans Richter at Manchester
and at London in December, 1908, we
find Elgar's method at its purest&mdash;the preoccupation
with spiritual states and experiences
is complete. It is true that this may be the
symphony upon which he was reported nine
years earlier to be at work, and which was to
bear the title "Gordon." If this is the case it
shows only that he was moved to musical
expression by the heroism of the great Englishman,
as Beethoven was by that of Napoleon
before it transpired that he was a tyrant. The
A-flat Symphony is not for that reason any
more program music than Beethoven's
"Eroica." The two are indeed similar in
being throughout profound searchings of the
human spirit, highly dramatic in the vividness
of their introspection, but never realistic.
They penetrate to a level far deeper than that
of action; they deal with the emotional springs
of action; we may even say that each suggests
a philosophy, since the philosophies, too, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
born of those deep inarticulate emotional attitudes
toward life which only music can voice
in their purity.</p>

<p>This fundamental attitude is in the A-flat
Symphony far more mature and chastened than
that of the ebulliently youthful "Eroica." If
we wished to find its analogue in Beethoven
(and it is a high compliment to Elgar to say
that there are few other places we could find it)
we should have to go rather to the Ninth
Symphony and to the later sonatas and quartets.
It is in essence the attitude of religious resignation,
and has as its constituents the primary
opposition between the ideal and reality, the
disappointment, softening, and impersonalizing
of the soul by experience, the reciprocal activity
of the soul winning its values out of experience,
and the final reconciliation between them. Of
course it is not meant that these ideas are intellectually
formulated in the music. It is
simply that the music expresses the emotional
states that accompany such universal human
experiences, and thus suggests and at the same
time by its beauty transfigures them.</p>

<p>The noble melody in A-flat major with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the symphony starts, recurring in the finale,
and indeed the nucleus of the whole work,
suggests aspiration, resolute will, the quest of
the Ideal. Everything about it,&mdash;its steady
movement, its simple, strong harmonic basis,
its finely flexible rhythm, notably free from the
short breath of the composer's less exalted
moments, even its rich and yet quiet tonality
of A-flat major, raises it into a rarefied atmosphere
of its own, above the turmoil of everyday
life. With the theme in D minor marked
Allegro appassionato, on the contrary, we are
brought rudely down to earth, with all its
confusion, its chaos, its meaningless accidents
(note the constant feverish motion of the bass,
the phantasmagoric nightmare harmonies at
index letter 7, the increasing restlessness of
the whole passage). Presently more poignant
or tender phrases (10 and 11) suggest the
longing of the spirit for the sweet reasonableness
of the lost ideal world, and at 12, in the
"second theme" in F major, we do get for a
moment a breathing interval of peace. The
beautiful, tender phrase, as of divine pity, beginning
in the fourth measure of 11 and ushering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in this theme, should be especially noticed
for its deep expressiveness and its complete
originality. This "phrase of pity," as we shall
see, is destined to play an important part in
the structure of the movement. Soon earlier
fragments return, reintroducing the restless
mood, the intensity of the feeling steadily grows,
and at 17 we have a magnificent climax in
which the "phrase of pity," much slower and
more emphatic than before, suggests the first
crisis of the struggle.</p>

<p>With the return of the theme of the ideal,
now in C major (18) and in tentative accents,
begins the long and complex development of
the themes. We need not go into detail here,
further than to remark that the strange, devious
new theme at 24 seems almost to have some
concrete "meaning," undisclosed by the composer,
and introduces the most baffling element
we find anywhere in the symphony. The
development proceeds much upon it. At 32
begins the recapitulation of themes of the orthodox
sonata-form, treated freely and with many
interesting modifications. The climax recurs at
44, now impressively amplified. Even finer is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the gradual but irresistible return of the fundamental
theme, the "Ideal," and its triumphant
statement through 49, 50, and 51. The sinister,
groping theme returns, however, seeming to
darken the atmosphere as when clouds come
over the sun. The "Ideal" theme is heard
in faltering, uncertain accents, and reaches,
just before 55, a timid cadence on the tone C.
Now comes one of the most exquisite things,
not only in this symphony, but in modern
music. While the clarinet holds this C, reached
in the original key of A-flat major, the muted
strings, high and tenuous, in the remote key of
A minor, like voices from another world, gently
breathe the "phrase of pity." It is magical.
With fine dignity of pace they reach the tone
C, whereupon we are again quietly but conclusively
brought back to A-flat, and with a
single plucked bass note the chord of the clarinets
sinks to silence (Figure XVII, page 128).</p>

<p>The two middle movements of the symphony,
Allegro molto (the scherzo) and Adagio, are
played without intervening pause and conceived
together. From the point of view both
of form and of content their treatment is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of exceeding interest. Structurally they are
an inset between the first movement and the
finale, contrasting sharply with them in key
as well as in melodic material, embodying as
they do the "sharp" keys (F-sharp minor and
D major) in opposition to the A-flat major and
D minor of the others. After this inset has
been completed, the earlier themes and keys
return in the finale and round out the cycle
projected by the first movement. Thus the
symphony as a whole consists of two interlocking
systems&mdash;a scheme of structure which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
gives it both variety and unity in the highest
degree.</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p128.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The scherzo begins with a racing, eagerly
hurrying theme, staccato, in the violins, in the
fastest possible tempo. Together with a more
vigorous, barbarically insistent tune to which
it presently (59) gives place, it seems a musical
expression of the forward-looking, all-conquering
spirit of youth. These themes are separately
elaborated, are displaced for a while by a
quieter Trio, and finally return with renewed
vigor, and at last in combination (75). And
now, as coda, comes one of the most remarkable
passages of the Symphony. The racing
theme returns (82), but now pianissimo, mysterious,
shorn of its pristine exuberance. It
hesitates, halts, seems to lose faith in itself.
It reappears in the more sombre key of F
minor, instead of F-sharp minor, and with
abated pace (84). A little later it sobers to a
still quieter movement, in eighth notes (86),
then (87) to quarter notes, and at last (90) the
clarinets give it out in a movement eight times
slower than the original headlong dash. Indeed,
the rhythm seems about to fail entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
when, with a change of key to D major, and of
time to Adagio, we hear the identical notes of
the original theme, sung now with broad deliberation
by the violins, completely transfigured
in meaning.</p>

<p>Thus begins the slow movement with the
coming of maturity, the taming of the blood,
the sadness of self-acquaintance no longer to
be postponed. The excitement of unlimited
possibilities gives place to the sober recognition
of limitations. Poignant grief there is
here, unanswered questioning, moments of
passionate despair. But with the beautiful
and thoroughly Elgarian theme at 96 begins
to creep in the spirit of resignation to the inevitable,
and of divine pity for human failure,
born of this bitter self-discovery. From this
point on is heard unmistakably the deeper note
of religious consolation, reaching full expression
at last in the melody marked <em>Molto espressivo
e sostenuto</em>, one of the noblest, profoundest, and
most spiritual that Elgar has conceived, with
which the movement ends.</p>

<p>The finale opens with a slow introduction,
intended partly to direct our attention back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to the first movement and partly to forecast
the strains destined to complete the cycle which
it began. We hear the mysterious groping
theme first heard in its development and fragments
of the "Ideal." Especial emphasis is
laid, however, on a march-like tune, given out
by bassoons and low strings at the sixth measure,
and on an aspiring phrase for clarinet
(measures 10-11) peculiar to the present movement.
The prevailing mood here, both in the
main theme with its emphatic interlocking
rhythms (the opening Allegro) and in the second
theme at 114, with its buoyant triplets recalling
the finale of Brahms's third symphony, is
energetic will. This seems to merge in jubilant
achievement in the march-like theme of the
introduction at its reëntrance at 118. For a
moment, to be sure, doubt as to this triumph
seems to be suggested by a rather halting
version of the "Ideal" (129) and by a pondering
version of the march theme (130). But
with the return of the main themes of the movement
at its recapitulation, beginning at 134
and now inflected towards A-flat, the radical
tonality of the whole symphony, the mood of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
vigorous volition revives, and from now on
to the splendid reassertion, by the full orchestra,
in its richest sonorities, of the theme of
the "Ideal," all is one long climax.</p>

<p>It is hard to see how any candid student can
deny the greatness of this symphony. If only
for the stoutness of its structure, the grasp
with which the fundamental principles of
musical form are seized, however the details
have to be modified to suit the occasion, and
for the richness and variety of its treatment
of orchestral coloring, it would hold a conspicuous
place among modern orchestral works.
But of course these things are only means;
the end of music is expression. It is, then,
to the fact that the symphony gives eloquent
voice to some of the deepest, most sacred, and
most elusive of human feelings that we must
attribute its real importance. That it does
this at a time when most musicians are looking
outward rather than inward, and incline to
value sensuous beauty above thought, and
vividness above profundity, gives us all the
more reason for receiving it with gratitude,
and finding in it a good omen for the future.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<br />
<small>CLAUDE DEBUSSY</small></h2>


<p>No peculiarity of contemporary
musical taste is more striking
than the extraordinary popularity
which the elusive songs
and piano pieces of Debussy
have enjoyed during the last decade or two.
They have been heard, with a delight agreeably
mixed with bewilderment, in the drawing-rooms
of the whole world, just as Grieg's
were at a slightly earlier period; and, like Grieg,
their author has become the idol of the amateur.
There is no doubt of it, Debussy has been the
prime musical fad of the twentieth century.
The fact is interesting&mdash;worth examination.
The reasons of it throw a strong light not only
on Debussy himself, but&mdash;which is more important&mdash;on
our whole contemporary musical
life.</p>

<p>Claude Achille Debussy, born in 1862 at St.
Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, and educated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at the Conservatoire, first gained wide fame
by his opera, "Pelléas et Mélisande," produced
at the Opéra Comique in 1902. By its imaginative
re-creation in music of Maeterlinck's
fatalism and atmosphere of mystery, by its
dramatic directness, its justice of declamation,
its moderation and avoidance of Wagnerian
exaggeration, perhaps above all by the originality
of its harmonic style and its delicately
tinted orchestration, it undoubtedly marked
an epoch in French music. Debussy had at
this time already fixed the fundamental qualities
of his style in such compositions as the
quartet for strings (1893), more virile than his
later works, and the well-known orchestral prelude
after a prose poem by Mallarmé, archpriest
of the symbolistic movement, "L'Après-midi
d'un faune." In later orchestral pieces,
the Nocturnes for orchestra (1899), the symphonic
sketches "La Mer" (1905), the highly
colored "Iberia" (1907), as well as in choral
works like the "Martyre de Saint Sébastien"
(1911), we see him refining the same manner,
seeking always, like his compatriot the poet
Verlaine, the subtleties, the delicacies, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shades and half-shades, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la nuance, la nuance
toujours</i>. It is, however, through his smaller
works&mdash;his songs and especially his piano
pieces&mdash;that Debussy is best known to the
mass of his admirers; and as the same qualities
reveal themselves here too, it is in these
that we shall try to understand them. In the
"Estampes" (1903), the "Masques" (1904),
the "Images" (1905 and 1908), the "Préludes"
(1910 and 1913), and many lesser pieces he has
created what is virtually a department of his
own in the literature of the piano. Here is the
essential Debussy.</p>

<p>The adaptation between the art and the
audience here, as is always the case where
there is extreme popularity, is so perfect that
we can equally well begin our study from either
end. Let us start with the audience. Not
that Debussy consciously sought to "give the
public what it wants"; no artist worthy the
name does that. What is meant is simply
that his qualities were spontaneously such as
exactly to satisfy his audience's requirements;
or, in biological terms, the organism was fortunate
enough to be exactly suited to its environment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
peculiarly "fit to survive." As
investigating biologists we can therefore either
approach the environment through the organism
or the organism through the environment&mdash;and
we choose to do the latter.</p>

<p>The environment of the modern composer
is a public numerically larger than ever before,
and qualitatively affected by this increased
size according to the law of averages&mdash;degraded,
that is, from the qualities of the minority
toward those of the majority. In less
abstract terms, the modern audience contains
to every one intelligent listener ten or a hundred
who are ignorant, untrained, or inattentive.
The results of this disproportion are
familiar to us on all sides; they range from
such a general matter as the very conception
of art, and especially of music, as a mere
amusement or diversion rather than a spiritual
experience, down to such details as the preference,
natural to the untrained, of sensuous
pleasure (in rich tone-combinations, for example)
to emotion and thought (as embodied
musically in melody), and of a vague day-dreaming
mood when listening to music to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
imaginative and sympathetic attention that
music requires of him who would really grasp
its objective beauty.</p>

<p>Now it is in his appeal to this modern preference
of sensation to thought and emotion,
and of subjective day-dreaming to the impersonal
perception of beauty, that Debussy
has been especially happy. He is not, of
course, alone in making these appeals. The
preoccupation with the sensuous is observable
in most contemporary music, an especially
striking instance being Strauss's orchestration.
As for the ministering to "mood" rather than
to the sense of beauty, the whole tendency
toward "program," so characteristic of our
time, might be accounted for by a cynic as a
sacrifice to the majority of something they do
not understand (music) to something they do
(an opportunity for day-dreaming). But Debussy
is peculiarly thoroughgoing in his application
of these familiar modern methods.
All the elements of his art are focused upon
this kind of satisfaction.</p>

<p>First he gives us a title admirably fitted (for
he has keen literary instinct) to liberate our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
reverizing impulse&mdash;"Gardens in the Rain,"
"Reflections in the Water," "Sounds and
Perfumes Turn in the Evening Air," "Gold-Fish,"
"Veils." Then he proceeds to establish
the mood of idle reverie thus suggested by
means of a tonal web which at no point distracts
our attention by any definite features
of its own, melodic, rhythmic, harmonic, or
structural. All is vague, floating, kaleidoscopic.
Sustained melody is especially avoided, for
nothing arrests attention or dominates mood
like melody; we have therefore only bits and
snippets of tune, forming and disappearing like
cloud forms or the eddies in smoke-wreaths.
The rhythms are equally casual and indeterminate,
often of exquisite grace, but obeying
no law. The harmonies are surprisingly various&mdash;rich,
clear, or clangorous, as the case
may be; but always elusive, avoiding the
definition that would impose thought rather
than encourage fancy. The effect of vagueness
is here enhanced by the much-talked-of
whole-tone scale. As there is little musical
thought or emotion (melody), there is still
less of that natural growth and combination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thought with thought which we call thematic
development and polyphony. These are alien
to the type of art, and are wisely avoided.</p>

<p>It is curious to compare Debussy's treatment
of his programs with that of Strauss. The
imagination of the German, however he may
call literary or pictorial associations to his
aid, is primarily musical. A literary idea may
suggest to him a theme, as Till Eulenspiegel's
capricious mischief strikes from him that surprising
Till motive, with its queer jumps and
galvanic rhythms. But once such a theme
exists it begins to act, musically, of itself, and
develops such a network of musically interesting
relationships that the listener, fascinated,
clean forgets the program in his
purely æsthetic delight. Strauss, probably,
forgets it too. He does for us, in spite of his
programs, exactly the kind of thing that
Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann do; he
creates intrinsically significant and expressive
musical forms (melodies) capable of absorbing
our attention and transfiguring all they touch&mdash;even
a rogue like Till Eulenspiegel&mdash;with
their æsthetic magic. The Frenchman's imagination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
on the contrary, is primarily literary,
dramatic, pictorial. He is led by it,
not to the creation of musically significant
forms, but to a keenly sympathetic realization
of the mood suggested by the program,
and to a most subtle musical evocation of it
by appropriate means, chiefly sensuous. He is
thus, literally, a painter of "mood pictures."
And as most people do not care to make the
effort to follow and relive a musical experience,
but prefer to be lulled by agreeable sounds into
a trance in which their fancy may weave adventures
and project pictures for itself, his
audience is delighted. From this point of
view symbolism is the type of art which most
appeals to the inartistic, and Debussy is the
musician most beloved by the unmusical.</p>

<p>We should not be talking about Debussy,
however, if these negatives were all there were
to say about him. Thousands of composers
before him have succeeded in avoiding definite
melody, rhythm, and harmony, coherent thematic
development, and thoughtful polyphony,
and have won only oblivion. His not distracting
out attention by these musical elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
is a part of his scheme of art, but the
more important part of it is the sensuous
charm by which he wins our interest and inhibits
our mental and emotional activity&mdash;the
sheer tonal magic of his sonorities. He is
a miracle of deftness in the purveying of musical
sweets. This is admitted even by his detractors,
who cannot deny the seductiveness
with which his music woos the physical ear,
however little it appeals to their heads or their
hearts. As for his admirers, they become
rhapsodic over these "effects" and "sonorities,"
which they praise with a half-religious
awe that used to be reserved for ideas. Listen,
for instance, to M. Chennevière,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> an accredited
expositor: "Voluptuous, corporeal, naturalistic&mdash;such
is the Debussyan art. The passions,
the sentiments, leave him often indifferent."
And again: "The modern ear has
become very fine, very delicate. It delights
in sonorities. A beautiful chord is a rare intoxication,
and sometimes an author repeats
it lingeringly, the better to savor it." If we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
adopt, at least tentatively, this frankly sensuous
and hedonistic view of music, we shall find
much to admire in Debussy.</p>

<p>In the long evolution from the simple to the
complex which music shares with everything
else we know we may observe two different
methods of tone-combination which, working
together, have given us the elaborate texture
of the modern art. That especially suited to
melodic instruments, like those used in the
orchestra or the chorus, puts melodies together
as an engraver puts together lines, each remaining
distinct, standing off clearly from
the others, representing a different musical
thought, and yet all agreeing, or, as we say,
harmonizing. This method, called polyphony,
requiring great skill in the composer and close
attention from the audience, is illustrated by
such masterpieces as a fugue of Bach, a string
quartet of Beethoven, or the famous passage
at the end of Wagner's Meistersinger Overture,
where four themes are driven abreast
as in some proud chariot. It results in a
texture essentially composite, involving relations
between elements held in mind together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
&mdash;that is to say, it is thoughtful, and requires
answering thought for its appreciation.</p>

<p>But as soon as the piano, ill suited to melody
because of its unsustained tone, began to reach
any degree of development&mdash;that is to say,
about the time of Schumann (1810-1856) and
Chopin (1809-1849)&mdash;it became evident that
this instrument compensated for its shortcomings
in rendering polyphony by a special
aptitude for another kind of tone-combination,
which we may call the homophonic or chordal.
A great many tones could be played at once,
held either by the fingers or by the damper-pedal,
and made to shimmer with those thousand
hues of the tonal rainbow we call "overtones."
There was apparently no limit to the
complexity of the agglomerations of tone that
the ear could thus be trained not only to
accept but to delight in&mdash;the rule being, as
Chopin in his "fluid and vaporous sonorities"
showed, that the greater in number and the
more dissonant or clashing in character were
these color tones, the more agreeably rich would
be the resulting impression on the ear.
But however complex these tone associations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
or chords, it is important to note that this
resultant psychological impression was simple
and unified&mdash;that is, the ear perceived but
one thing, and not several as in the polyphonic
style. There was therefore no comparison of
different elements, no thought or emotion;
there was simply sensation, physically delightful,
mentally and emotionally meaningless.</p>

<p>Debussy has probably brought more talent
and originality to the elaboration of this
method of writing for the piano than any other
composer since Chopin and Schumann. Open
his pages anywhere and you will find these
wide-spaced chords, these gossamer arpeggios
and scales embroidering them, these nicely
calculated grace-notes adding just the dissonance
needed to season the dish. Take,
for instance, the opening measures of "La
Cathédrale engloutie" (Figure XVIII), characteristically
marked "Profoundly calm (in a
softly sonorous mist)."</p>

<p>The intention to produce a misty, not to
say foggy, homogeneity of tone here is so
obvious that it seems strange that just such
passages have aroused the ire of pedants who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
have tried to apply to them the rules of the
other way of writing&mdash;the polyphonic. When
we wish diverse melodies to stand out clearly
one from another, we must avoid "parallel
fifths and octaves," which make them coalesce.
Accordingly Debussy has been blamed, by
those who prefer rules to reason, for using
precisely the device which will give him the
physical richness with mental vacuity which
he is seeking.</p>

<p>When this admirable colorist wishes a
brighter or more incisive sonority than one of
this kind, he resorts to dissonances, and especially
to the interval of the "second"&mdash;notes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
adjacent in the scale. The opening
measures of "Et la lune descend sur le temple
qui fut" (Figure XIX) afford an example of
this in a quiet tone; more clangorous qualities
of it will be found in "Masques," "L'île
joyeuse," and "Jardins sous la pluie." The
first example illustrates what was said of the
simplicity for the mind, whatever the complexity
for the ear, of this kind of tone-combination.
The chords contain a good many
notes each; but there emerges only one melody,
and that rather obvious.</p>

<p>The same search for rich or brilliant color
that led to this use of "seconds," carried a
little further, brought the composer to that
whole-tone scale (or scale entirely made up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of "seconds," as C, D, E, F-sharp, G-sharp,
A-sharp, C) which he has used with such
irresistible appeal. He has, to be sure, no
patent right in it. Moussorgsky, Borodine,
and others had used it before him; his French
contemporaries have used it with skill; and
now that it is common property some have
even elicited from it strains of plangent force
and manly energy foreign to Debussy's temperament.
The fact remains that he has
made it peculiarly his own by the subtlety,
variety, and charm of his employment of
it, as may be seen, for example, throughout
"Voiles," in the first book of Préludes, and
in scattered measures in almost any of his
pieces. The whole-tone scale is indeed pre-ordained
by nature as a goal to which such an
art as Debussy's inevitably tends; its clashing
tones feed the greedy ear with the richest
diet the gamut can provide; at the same time
the equivocal character of the chords, or rather
the single chord (the so-called "augmented
triad") that can harmonize it, and the self-contradictoriness
of its tones from the point of
view of the older scale, do away with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sense of key and even of momentary repose,
and leave us groping in a tonal night in which,
since there is nothing to be observed, we can
give ourselves up undisturbed to dreaming.</p>

<p>Debussy is thus a true child of his time in
his quest of the sensuous, and a true child of
his country in the subtlety with which he pursues
it. His Gallic taste saves him from the
coarseness of so much of the contemporary
Teutonic art; and while his aim is no more
spiritual than that of the Germans, he prefers
innuendo, implication, and understatement to
the gross exaggeration of Strauss, the vehemence
in platitude of Mahler, and the plodding
literalness of Reger. Thus opposing,
as he has so effectively done, the ideal of
mere force, reducing in "Pelléas" the mammoth
modern orchestra to a handful of men
skilfully exploited, substituting the most elusive
sonorities of the piano for the crashing
magnificence of the Liszt school, everywhere
insisting on subtle quality rather than overwhelming
quantity, he has exercised one of
the most beneficial of influences against vulgarity
of the bumptious type. But sybaritism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
too, has its own vulgarity; the question of
aim is fundamental in art; and in judging the
distinction of Debussy's aims we cannot evade
the question whether physical pleasure, however
refined, is the highest good an artist can
seek. His charm, beyond doubt, is great
enough to justify his popularity. Yet it would
be regrettable if the student of modern French
music, satisfied with this charm, were to
neglect the less popular but more virile, more
profound, and more spiritual music of César
Franck, Ernest Chausson, and Vincent d'Indy.</p>

<h2>V<br />

<small>VINCENT d'INDY</small></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Our age, because of the natural
failure of our inner powers, at
first, to keep pace with the recent
unprecedented increase of
our external resources, will probably
be known to the future as one of unparalleled
confusion. With the mental and moral
habits and the nervous systems inherited from
a more placid generation, we find ourselves
plunged in this maelstrom produced by cheap
printing, quick communication, and facile
transportation. Prepared to digest only a limited
environment, we are fed the whole world.
No wonder we are distracted.... The situation,
of course, is full of interest to the more
adventurous temperaments; but however stimulating
to the man of action it is scarcely
favorable to the artist, since art is born only
of tranquil emotion, firmly grasped and clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
arranged. Most contemporary musicians are
thus bewildered and to some extent defeated
by the very richness of the materials at hand;
their art is not equal to the strain put upon it
by their greatly enlarged resources; and their
music is in consequence unindividual in expression,
flabbily eclectic in style, and vague or
wandering in structure.</p>

<p>It may seem at first thought paradoxical
that these melancholy results of a momentary
insufficiency of the mind to its materials
should have proved most fatal precisely in the
country that in simpler times has done most
to create music. Strange it is, indeed, that
Germany, which in Beethoven voiced the
spiritual aspiration, in Schumann the romantic
joy, and in Brahms the philosophic
meditation of the whole world, should find
itself at length reduced to the half-impotent
strivings of a Mahler, to the learned lucubrations
of a Reger, while mixed with even the
gold of its one genius, Strauss, there should be
so much dross of cheap sensationalism and
irrelevant melodrama. Yet to consideration
these signs of a widespread decadence in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
German music will not by any means remain
incomprehensible. For it will be seen that
the Teutonic introspectiveness, the supreme
gift of that temperament, incomparable and
sufficient endowment as it seemed in the
musicians of the great period, hardly suffices
those who have to steer their way in a much
more complicated environment, surrounded by
pitfalls, calling at every step for qualities with
which the typical German is by no means
so well supplied&mdash;intelligence, discrimination,
moderation, and taste. It is the lack of these
intellectual or spiritual qualities, rather than
any falling off in purely emotional power, that
has brought the great stream of music that
flowed through Bach, Beethoven, Schumann,
and Brahms to its end in the stagnant morasses
of contemporary Kapellmeistermusik,
or scattered it in the showy but unsatisfying
jets of sensationalism. And as Russia still
remains a bit barbaric, England a little provincial,
America immature, and Italy tainted
with operaticism (an ugly word for an ugly
thing), it is chiefly in France, with its racial
genius of lucid intelligence, that we find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
truly vital contemporary music. There we
owe it chiefly to the high creative genius of
César Franck, Belgian by birth and temperament,
French in education and intellectual
clarity, and to the loyal co-labors, creative,
critical, and educational, of his pupils and disciples.
If there is to-day, despite the confusions
of the time, a clear tradition and a hopeful
future for instrumental music, it is chiefly
these modern Frenchmen that we have to
thank.</p>

<p>Especially has Vincent d'Indy, to-day dominant
in the group, contributed to its work for
many years the indefatigable efforts of his
powerful and many-sided personality, more
variously gifted than any of the others, since
he is not only a composer of genius, but a
lucid writer, an able organizer, and a teacher
and conductor of singular magnetism. He
came under the influence of Franck at his
most plastic period; he was a youth of twenty-two
when, in 1873, he entered Franck's organ
class at the Paris Conservatoire; and of the
circumstances, characteristic of both teacher
and pupil, under which this most fruitful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
relationship began, he has himself written in
his "Life of Franck."</p>

<p>"Having with great trouble," he says, "got
upon paper a formless quartet for piano and
strings, I asked Franck for an appointment.
When I had played him the first movement,
he remained a moment silent, and then, turning
toward me with a sad air, he said to me
words I have never forgotten, since they had
a decisive action on my life: 'There are good
things here, energy, a certain instinct for
dialogue of the parts, ... the ideas are not
bad, ... but that is not enough, it is not
made, and, in short, <em>you know nothing at all</em>.'
Returning home in the night (the interview
had taken place very late in the evening) I
said to myself, in my wounded vanity, that
Franck must be a reactionary, understanding
nothing of youthful, modern art. Nevertheless,
calmer the next morning, I took
up my unhappy quartet and recalled one by
one his observations, ... and I was obliged
to admit that he was right: I knew absolutely
nothing. I went then, almost trembling, to
ask him to accept me as a pupil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time Franck, already fifty-one years
old, was little appreciated as a composer,
appeared to the world as a hard-worked organist
who taught ten hours a day and wrote
for two hours before breakfast works seldom
heard, and had indeed not yet discovered the
vein from which he so enriched music during
the last ten years of his life. Nevertheless
d'Indy at once recognized the fruitfulness of
his ideas, devoted himself to a severe technical
discipline in accordance with them, and
assumed that rôle of filial defender and expositor
of them in which he has never wearied
from that day to this. There is something
not only rarely beautiful in itself, but most
characteristic of the purity of d'Indy's self-forgetful
devotion to music, in the loyalty which
he has always given to his "Pater seraphicus,"
as Franck's artistic sons called him,
from the period when as a student he left the
conservatory which misprized his master, to
the day when, himself a master, he published
his "Life of Franck." M. Romain Rolland
gives us a picture of it in his description of the
first performance, in March, 1888, of Franck's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
"Theme, fugue, and variation" for harmonium
and piano, at a concert of the <cite>Société
nationale de musique</cite>, when Franck played
the harmonium, and d'Indy the piano. "I
always remember," says M. Rolland,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> "his
respectful attitude toward the old musician,
his studious care to follow his indications:
one would have thought he was a pupil, attentive
and docile; and this was touching
from a young master, established by so many
works&mdash;the <cite>Chant de la Cloche</cite>, <cite>Wallenstein</cite>,
the <cite>Symphonie sur un thème montagnard</cite>&mdash;and
perhaps better known and more popular than
César Franck himself. Since then twenty
years have passed; I continue to see him as I
saw him that evening; and whatever happens
now his image will remain always for me
closely associated with that of the great master
dominating, with a paternal smile, this small
assembly of faithful ones."</p>

<p>This "small assembly of faithful ones," the
pupils of Franck, such as Duparc, Chausson,
Coquard, Bordes, Ropartz, Benoit, d'Indy,
as well as others, like Saint-Saëns and Fauré,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
who, though not his pupils, have felt his influence,
have virtually created since 1870,
largely under his inspiration, a new music
in France. The story of it may be read in M.
Rolland's book, in the essay "Le renouveau."
At the time of the Franco-Prussian War (in
which d'Indy served as a corporal of the 105th
regiment), symphonic and chamber music
suffered almost complete neglect in Paris.
"Before 1870," writes M. Saint-Saëns,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "a
French composer who had the folly to venture
into the domain of instrumental music,
had no other way to get his works played than
to organize a concert himself, inviting his
friends and the critics. The rare chamber
music societies were as much closed to all new
comers as the orchestral concerts; their programs
contained only the celebrated names,
above discussion, of the great classic symphonists.
At that time one had truly to be
bereft of all common sense to write music.
It was in order to correct this state of things
that a group of musicians organized in February,
1871, the <cite>Société nationale de musique</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
with the device 'Ars gallica,' and the avowed
end of 'aiding the production and familiarization
of all serious musical works, of French
composers, and of encouraging, so far as may
be in its power, all musical tentatives, of
whatever kind, which show on the part of
their author elevated and artistic aspirations.'"
M. Rolland does not hesitate to call the <cite>Société
nationale</cite> "the cradle and the sanctuary of
French art." "All that has been great in
French music from 1870 to 1900," he says,
"has come by way of it. Without it the
greater part of the works which are the honor
of our music not only would not have been
performed, but perhaps would not even have
been written." And he draws from the programs
records of the performance of important
compositions by Franck, Saint-Saëns, d'Indy,
Chabrier, Lalo, Bruneau, Chausson, Debussy,
Dukas, Lekeu, Magnard, and Ravel.</p>

<p>Vincent d'Indy's personal contribution to
the work of the society began to be considerable
from 1881 on, when the influence of the
Franck school became dominant. In 1886
his proposal to include in the programs the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
works of classic and foreign composers led
to the resignation of Saint-Saëns and Bussine.
In 1890, at the death of Franck, he became
president of the society. Under his influence
the representation of classical works has particularly
increased&mdash;Palestrina, Vittoria, Josquin,
Bach, Handel, Rameau, Gluck, as well
as Beethoven, Schumann, Liszt, Brahms.
Foreign contemporary music has been represented
chiefly by Strauss, Grieg, and the Russians.
In recent years the <cite>Société nationale</cite>
has been charged with taking on too exclusive
a character, especially with guarding the
traditional at the expense of the new; and
the <cite>Société musicale indépendante</cite> has been
founded by some of the younger men as a
protest.</p>

<p>In 1900 d'Indy became president of the
Schola Cantorum, founded six years earlier
by Charles Bordes, Alexandre Guilmant, and
himself, primarily for the cultivation of the
church music based on the Gregorian chant.
In his discourse of inauguration he explained
his purpose of enlarging the function of the
school to cover all musical instruction; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
while characteristically insisting that the
means to renovate modern music were to be
found in the study of "the decorative art of
the plain chant, the architectural art of the
Palestrina period, and the expressive art of the
great Italians of the seventeenth century,"
yet promised to take his students "through
the same path that art has followed, so that,
undergoing in their period of study the transformations
music has undergone through the
centuries, they will emerge from it so much
the better armed for the modern combat, in
that they will have lived, so to speak, the
life of art, and will have assimilated in their
natural order the forms which have logically
succeeded each other in the different epochs of
artistic development." Both in the special
leaning toward the music of the church which
his devout and somewhat mystical temperament
here suggested, and in the broad eclecticism
with which his intelligence insisted on
combining it, he showed clearly the influence
of his master César Franck, whom indeed he
asserted to be in a sense "the grandfather of
this Schola Cantorum, since it is his system of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
teaching that we endeavor to continue and
apply here." Like his master he wished to
cultivate in his students both a solid learning,
without which nothing vital can be contributed
to art, and the enthusiasm without which
it degenerates into pedantry. To understand
the great influence for good exerted on French
music by the Schola, we need only recall d'Indy's
description of "the noble teaching of César
Franck, founded on Bach and Beethoven, but
admitting besides all enthusiasms, all new and
generous aspirations."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the sixteen years that d'Indy has been
at the head of the Schola Cantorum he has
accomplished an amount of unselfish labor
for the advancement of music that would
have been extraordinary under any circumstances,
and becomes almost incredible when
we remember that in the same period he has
produced over half a dozen original works of
the first importance. He is indeed a man
of unusual physical, nervous, and mental
strength, accustomed to indefatigable labor.
Thus in addition to all his teaching he organizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
operatic performances and choral, orchestral,
and chamber-music concerts; he conducts,
and teaches others to conduct; he edits the
classics&mdash;Rameau, Destouches, Solomon de
Rossi&mdash;and the folk-songs of his native mountains
of the Vivarais; he gives lectures and
makes studies of the predecessors of Beethoven,
of Franck; he writes criticisms for the monthly
press; and, most serviceable of all perhaps to
distant students, he describes the principles of
his art in a masterly and exhaustive treatise,
the "Cours de composition musicale," unfortunately
not yet translated into English.</p>

<p>And all this is only his winter work. In
the summer he retires to his château of Faugs,
near the little mountain village of Boffres,
in Ardèche, and there, in a room in the tower,
whence on a clear day he can see Mt. Blanc,
he composes the works in which these principles
are so nobly exemplified. Besides the
early "Chant de la Cloche," by which he won
the grand prize of the city of Paris in 1885 and
first established his reputation, he has written
three other large choral works: the two operas
"Fervaal" (1895) and "L'Étranger" (1901),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and the oratorio "La Légende de St. Christophe,"
recently completed. For orchestra,
aside from the early trilogy of symphonic
poems "Wallenstein," over-Wagnerian in
inspiration, and other early or lesser works,
there are four masterpieces of the first order:
"Istar," symphonic variations, 1896; the second
Symphony, in B flat, 1904; the symphony,
"Un Jour d'Été à la Montagne,"
1905; and the symphonic poem "Souvenirs,"
written to the memory of his wife, 1906. This
incomplete list may be finished with three
equally masterly chamber-music pieces: the
second String Quartet, E major, 1897; the
Violin Sonata, 1904, and the Piano Sonata,
1907&mdash;not to mention the youthful Piano
Quartet of 1878, or the delightful Trio for
Clarinet, Violoncello, and Piano of 1887.</p>

<p>What, then, are these fundamental principles
of composition which d'Indy has insisted
upon in his teaching, promulgated in
the "Cours de composition musicale," and
exemplified in his works? They are all, in
essence, but differing forms of the central
principle of all art, of all beauty&mdash;that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
utmost variety must be but the outgrowth
and flowering of a perfect unity. We have
seen that many modern composers, baffled
by the richness of the materials with which
they had to deal, have failed in the effort
thus to stamp unity upon them: their art
has been confused and fragmentary. Others
again&mdash;the pseudo-classics and reactionaries&mdash;have
resorted to a violent simplification of
the material in order to preserve unity, and
have thus impoverished their art. Only the
greatest, in the first rank of whom must be
placed Franck and d'Indy, have had at once
a firm enough hold upon musical tradition
and a broad enough command of new methods
and idioms to write music at once various
and unified, at once thoroughly "modern"
and thoroughly sane. To this unifying power
of d'Indy's mind M. Rolland pays a fine
tribute. "Clearness!" he cries, "it is the mark
of M. d'Indy's intelligence. There are no
shadows in him. His thought and his art are
as clear as his look, which gives to his face so
much of youth. It is a necessity for him to
judge, to order, to classify, to unify. Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was there a spirit more French.... And
this is the more remarkable in that his nature
is far from being simple. Through a wide
musical education, a constant desire to learn,
it has been enriched by many elements, different,
almost contradictory.... Not to be
submerged by this richness of opposing elements
requires a great force of passion or of will,
which eliminates or chooses and transforms.
M. d'Indy eliminates almost nothing: he organizes.
There are in his music the qualities
of a general: the knowledge of the end, the
patient will to attain it, the perfect acquaintance
with the means, the spirit of order, and
the mastery over his work and over himself.
Despite the variety of the materials he employs,
the whole is always clear."</p>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p171.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>If we examine, as typical of d'Indy's mature
style, a passage such as the introduction to
the slow movement of the B flat Symphony,
shown in Figure XX, we are struck at once
by the complexity of the detail&mdash;the bold
unexpectedness of the melodic lines, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
chromatic harmony, the constantly varying
rhythms&mdash;and by the perfect final clearness
with which it nevertheless impresses us, so
that each note seems inevitable and the whole
unmistakable in meaning. It is this combination
of complexity and simplicity, characteristic
more or less of all really great
modern composers but perhaps to a peculiar
degree of d'Indy, that we have to analyze
and account for to ourselves in some detail if
we would thoroughly understand his music.
What is the mysterious power in him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
enables him to give so distinctly personal a
stamp to elements drawn from so many
sources? What is the unifying principle in
all this variety? What lifts this insatiable
student above his studies, and renders his
knowledge not a dead lumber weighing down
his mind, but a living force making it fruitful?
For of the extent of these studies, benumbing
to any but the freshest mind, there is plenty
of evidence in his work as well as in his
critical writings; if it were worth while we
might enumerate "influences" at great length.
There would be, for instance, the fundamental
influence of Bach and Beethoven, and the
more superficial influence of the romantics,
Schumann and Mendelssohn, as shown in
"Wallenstein" (1873-1879), and other early
works. There would be the potent Wagnerian
influence, of which "Fervaal" is the chief
monument, although it appears in all that
he has written; and there would be the even
more pervasive and inspiring influence of his
master, Franck. We should have to take
account, too, of the reflection, especially in
later works like the piano sonata, the violin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sonata, and the second symphony, of the
harmonic idiom of Debussy and other contemporaries,
the whole-tone scale, and the
like. And under these individual influences
we should find more general, subtle, and
pervasive ones, we should find the great communal
streams of the French folk-song and
the Gregorian plain chant. Yet all these
streams, and others too many to mention,
have been gathered up into one clear personality.
What has been the transmuting
magic?</p>

<p>The composer himself suggests the answer
in several passages that may here be brought
together.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly logical," he writes in <cite>Mercure
de France</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> "and in the order of things
that, when a man of genius shows himself
in one country, the artists of the other nations
try to assimilate his processes. I see nothing
reprehensible in that, and this international
free trade even appears to me one of the vital
conditions of the development of art....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>Moreover, can the artist ever, in spite of all
influences, give anything else than the art that
he carries in himself?"</p>

<p>"You ask me," he says to an interviewer
of the <cite>Revue Bleue</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> "to define French music.
In reality there is no French music, and in
general there is no national music. There is
<em>music</em>, which is of no country; there are
musical masterpieces, which belong to no one
nation." He is led on to an interesting comparison
of our period, in its desire for greater
simplicity, with the end of the sixteenth century,
and the illuminating statement: "M.
Debussy is a little our Monteverde; he abandons
melody for recitative, for 'the representative
style,' as they said in the first years of
the seventeenth century; he renounces the
resources of counterpoint, he even foregoes
modulation." But when the interviewer, seeking
to entrap him into condemnation of his
contemporary which would make good copy,
asks, "And do you not desire rather the triumph
of melody and polyphony?" he replies:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have but one desire; it is that they write
beautiful things." The third passage is one
of the axioms that he gives to his students
at the Schola Cantorum: "All processes are
good, on condition that they never become the
principal end, but are regarded only as means
for making music." And finally he makes his
meaning even more definite in a discussion of
M. Roger Ducasse:<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "I am sure that when
M. Ducasse is willing to trust himself more to
the impulses of his heart rather than to researches
in sonorities, he will be able to make
very beautiful music. There is in art, truly,
nothing but the heart that can produce beauty&mdash;(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il
n'est vraiment, en art, que le c&#339;ur pour
engendrer de la beauté</i>)."</p>

<p>Yes, it is his heart that guides his mind
through the mazes of its knowledge; it is his
luminous sincerity that shines through all he
writes, however complex it may be in detail;
both the warmth and the light of his music
come from his emotion. Responsive emotion
in the listener, accordingly, is the key to the
intricacies of his style. If we attend to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
letter only we are baffled, bewildered: there
are so many notes, such queer progressions,
in that passage from the symphony, for example.
But if we hearken for the spirit, all
becomes clear, and strangely moving. It is
waxing and waning feeling, a wave of emotion,
that expresses itself in that rise to the strident
B of the fourth measure and in the subsequent
hesitating descent. And as emotion is the
motive force of the whole, emotion it is also
that explains the details.</p>

<p>Take for instance the very texture of the
melody. We note two contrasting figures
or motives, one, which we may call <em>a</em>, melancholy
or at least contemplative, characterized
by the fall of a fourth, and another, <em>b</em>, in
which the more vigorous rise of a seventh
gives a sense of opposing will. The whole
passage is wrought from these two contrasting
yet mutually supplementing strands with
singular concentration. There is not a note,
save the chords in the last two measures, that
does not belong to one or the other. There
is something relentless in such insistence.
The grip is not relaxed for a moment. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thought is hammered in. The music throbs
like a pulse. Yet there is in this insistence
nothing of the monotony of mere repetition;
the feeling never stagnates. On the contrary,
each assertion accumulates fresh force, the
emotion rises by its own expression, and there
is ordered, purposeful, relentless progression.
Thus motive <em>a</em> is stated first from D flat;
then, at *3, from D, higher and louder; then,
at *5, from E flat but this time fairly carried
off its feet by its oppugnant fellow, <em>b</em>. Similarly
<em>b</em>, first heard quietly, almost timidly, in
the bass, in the key of D flat, at *2, is repeated
at *4 more firmly and in the key of D minor,
making it in the main higher than before
though starting on the same note; finally it
appears in the treble, as just stated, at *5, and
rises as in a passionate cry to the B, whence it
slowly subsides. In short, we see here a
"logic of emotion" quite as absolute as that
of the reason, and far more appropriate to
music, in which mere reason must be content
with a subordinate place. As always in the
best music, the logic of emotion involves
both the fundamental unity of the motives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
(since no emotion would amount to much if it
was so weak that it forgot what it was about)
and their gradual cumulative growth in diversity
as they realize themselves in expression.
Even d'Indy's music is not always so
true to the logic of emotion as this, as we shall
have occasion later to notice; even Homer
nods; but the motival variety in unity of all
good melody, as a result of its emotional
origin, is none the less ineluctable as a principle.</p>

<p>Looking again at the passage we may note
more specifically the interest, vitality, and
flexibility of its rhythms. This is again, as
in all the composer's best work, ultimately
due to truth to emotion. Motive <em>b</em> occurs
three times, but never twice the same. The
second time, at *4, it enters earlier in the
measure than before, as if impatient, and
ends with the persistent tramp of quarter
notes. The third time it strikes in almost
roughly (*5), its second and third notes are
displaced&mdash;syncopated&mdash;by agitation, while
its last three notes, comprising the crisis and
its subsidence, are lengthened out from a
half measure to a measure and a half. (See
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Figure XXI.) We see thus exemplified the
basic principles of expression through rhythm,
the hastening or compression of the phrase in
response to passion, its retardation or expansion
with returning calm. "Expression,"
writes d'Indy,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> "consists in the translation of
sentiments and impressions, by the aid of certain
characteristic modifications, affecting the
rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic forms of the
musical discourse.... <em>Agogique</em>, consisting
in the modifications of the rhythmic movement,&mdash;precipitation,
slackening, regular and
irregular interruptions, etc.&mdash;has for its effect
to render the relative impressions of <em>calm</em> and
<em>agitation</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a conception of rhythm, emphasizing
its sensitive fluctuation in response to mood,
and demanding of the artist complete sincerity
and flexibility of expression, is at the
pole from the conventional notion of it as an
almost mechanical balancing of equal sections
of melody, cut off so to speak with a yardstick.
D'Indy leaves his readers in no doubt
as to his opinion of all such conventional
sing-song, the doggerel of music. "To beat
the time and to give the rhythm of a musical
phrase," he says,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "are two completely distinct
operations, often opposed. The coincidence
of the rhythm and the measure is
an entirely particular case, which men have
unfortunately tried to generalize, propagating
the error that 'the first beat of the measure
is always strong.' This identification of
rhythm with measure has had the most
deplorable consequences for music....
Rhythm, submitted to the restricting requirements
of meter, becomes rapidly impoverished,
even to the most desolating platitude,
just as a branch of a tree, strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
compressed by a ligature, becomes enfeebled
and atrophied, while its neighbors absorb all
the sap."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Again: "In the seventeenth century
the bar-line ceased to be simply a graphic
sign; it became a periodic starting point for
the rhythm, which it soon robbed of all its
liberty and elegance. Hence come those
symmetrical and square-cut forms to which
we owe a great part of the platitudes of the
Italianism of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Finally, summing the whole
matter up in a sentence: "The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carrure</i>
[that is, square-cut phrase-balance, symmetry
by measures, narrowly limited to the number
4 and its multiples] is an element of vulgarity,
rarely useful outside of certain special forms
of dance music."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The vulgarity of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carrure</i>, of sing-song,
as we may call it in English, is due, it cannot
be too much insisted upon, to the mental
and emotional inertia, the thoughtlessness,
the surrender to the mechanism of habit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of which it is the product and the index.
It proceeds from a conventionality essentially
unspontaneous, uncreative, a conventionality
that permits the length and shape of the
phrase to be imposed by convenience, ease,
and precedent rather than by the emotion
it ought to incarnate. Hence sing-song
is found not only in all music which,
like so-called "popular songs," emanates from
trivial people or from people only superficially
moved, but also in the music even of
sincere composers in their moments of inattention,
pretentiousness, or routine. Even
so fine a composer as Elgar is frequently
banal in rhythm. On the other hand, deeply
felt work always spontaneously assumes individual
rhythmic outlines; and undoubtedly
such free and unstereotyped outlines, though
to the initiated listener they constitute
one of its most potent and lasting beauties,
and thus are an essential condition of
its longevity, repel at first by their apparent
eccentricity or "obscurity" the uninitiated
and the inattentive, and thus postpone
its general acceptance. Thus the attribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to d'Indy of "dryness" and "lack of
melody" which one sometimes hears may be
taken as an inverted tribute to the spontaneity
of his melody and especially of his
rhythms. Only one who did not feel sympathetically
the wide ground swell of those
phrases from the symphony could find them
groping or uncertain because they did not fall
into exactly four measures. The moment one
felt the coördinating force of their fresh personal
emotion one would not regret the absence
of the conventional strait-jackets.</p>

<p>It is emotion again that explains his attitude
toward harmony. Just as he is ahead of
most of his contemporaries in the fundamental
and surprisingly neglected matter of
rhythm, because he conceives it as so flexible
an instrument of expression, so he is rather
at odds with many of them, especially with
the impressionist school in his own country,
on the much studied&mdash;perhaps over-studied&mdash;question
of harmony, because he conceives
harmony as primarily expressive, while they
conceive it as primarily sensuous.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> A clue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to his attitude is that sentence of his in criticism
of Ducasse: "I am sure that when
M. Ducasse is willing to trust himself more
to the impulses of his heart rather than to
researches in sonorities, he will be able to
make very beautiful music." "Researches
in sonorities"&mdash;that is, in the minds of the
group of French composers led by Debussy,
almost a synonym for harmony; what they
ask of harmony is combinations of tone delicious
to the physical ear: subtly, delicately
delicious, no doubt, and to a highly refined
ear, but still aiming consciously at the ear
rather than at the mind or the heart. The
means of satisfying such a desire being sensations,
aural sensations ingeniously built up
and combined, they have rightly concentrated
their attention on the single moment of merged
sounds&mdash;the chord&mdash;rather than on the
procession of separate sounds&mdash;the melody,
and its relation to other melodies sounding
with it. "Accord," "sonorité"&mdash;these are
the slogans of the impressionists.</p>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p186.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>To d'Indy, on the other hand, harmony,
like all the other technical elements of music, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
primarily a means of expression, and therefore
results rather from the confluence of
melodies, themselves dictated by emotion,
than from the adjustment of sonorities to
please the ear. One has only to look again
at the passage from the symphony to see how
such an attitude works out in practise. There
is no preoccupation here with "effect"; the
harmony, one might almost say, receives no
attention for itself, but is solely a result of
the melodic movements; yet so free and expressive
are these movements, so truly conceived
to voice the emotions behind them,
and combined with such art, that this resultant
harmony is far more poignant, far more
fresh and unexpected and striking than if it
had been confected for itself alone. And
this is natural and easily comprehensible,
since we should not expect any amount of
ingenuity spent on the single chord to achieve
the results that melodies, feeling out into the
unknown, easily attain. Such an attitude
toward harmony requires, it is true, a certain
daring: you cannot swim with your feet on
the ground; but the freedom of movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
you get by trusting yourself to the waves
amply compensates your faith.</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p187.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>This melodic conception of harmony has
always been a fundamental characteristic of
d'Indy's style, as examples from widely sundered
periods will easily show. The first, Figure
XXII, is a bit from the Chant Elégiaque
in the early Trio for Clarinet, Cello, and
Piano (1887). The charming unexpectedness
of the twist back into E major is thorough
d'Indy, as is also the use of a persistent figure
(given to the cello in the original) and the
rhythmic modification of this same figure
to provide the bass in the second measure.
The second passage, shown in Figure XXIII,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
dates from thirty years later, and appears
in "Souvenirs" (1906). Here again the melodies
"find a way," and a more interesting,
vista-opening way than any sonorities could
suggest. Such passages enable us to get the
full sense of what their composer means when
he writes: "The study of chords <em>for themselves</em>
is, from the musical point of view, an absolute
æsthetic error, for harmony springs from
melody, and ought never to be separated from
it in its application.... There is only one
chord, the perfect chord [triad], alone consonant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
because it alone gives the sense of
repose or equilibrium. All the combinations
that people call 'dissonant chords,' necessitating,
in order to be examined, an artificial
arrest in the melodies that constitute them,
have no proper existence, since in making
abstraction of the movement that engenders
them, one suppresses their unique reason for
being. Chords have too often become the end
of music; they ought never to be anything
but a means, a consequence, a phenomenon
essentially transient."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It may be held that
d'Indy sometimes goes too far in his denunciations
of harmonic theories based on the conception
of the "chord," as for example in
his note on the famous opening phrase of
"Tristan and Isolde." It may also be justly
remarked that his own method is not always
happy in its results&mdash;that the way his melodies
find is sometimes an obscure and wandering,
or an unnatural and forced way.
Nevertheless it remains on the whole true that
on the one hand the chord conception of harmony
has been responsible for a vast mass of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
pedantry, and has paralyzed and hamstrung
whole generations of students, and that on
the other hand it favors the purely sensuous
trifling with tones of which there is so much
in our day; while the best pages of Bach,
Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Franck, d'Indy
show a thousand beauties and poignancies
which without the help of melody could never
have been discovered.</p>

<p>In the course of Kaito's prophecy, in "Fervaal,"
there is a deeply moving passage to the
words: "Only Death, baleful Death, shall
summon Life," which strikingly illustrates
its composer's way of making all the elements
of music contribute to expression (see Figure
XXIV). Here the upward inflection of the
voice, the strange intervals, the vague harmonies,
the halting movement, even the sighing
syncopation of the bass, all contribute to
the interpretation of the opening lines. But
above all, how inexplicably stirring is the
gradual increase of force and rise of pitch up
to the clear chord of D major (note the composer's
indication, "Clair") at the word
"Life" ("Vie")! Gloom and mystery give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
place to hope, faith, will, to which the ecclesiastical
harmonies lend an unmistakable religious
coloring. This change, completely
spontaneous in effect, is dictated by an art
that conceals itself, and introduces us to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of the most individual features of d'Indy's
harmonic technique, his ease of modulation.
In his <cite>Cours de Composition Musicale</cite> he has
worked out his theories of the expressive use
of modulation with characteristic thoroughness,
and with unprecedented amplitude of
detail. To resume his points here, however,
interesting as they are, would take us too
deeply into technical matters, especially as
our main interest is now in his application
rather than in his statement of them. The
essential principles may therefore be briefly
summarized, in his own words, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) "Expression is the unique reason for
being of modulation."</p>

<p>(2) "Modulation operates by a displacement
of the tonic ['key-note'], by its oscillation
towards the higher fifths [that is, towards
the sharper keys, as to G, D, A, etc., from C]
or towards the lower fifths [that is, towards
the flatter keys, as to F, B flat, E flat, etc.,
from C]."</p>

<p>(3) "Modulation has for its effect to render
relative impressions of brightness [that
is, movement towards sharper keys produces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</i>'] or of darkness [movement
towards flatter keys produces '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assombrissement</i>']."</p>

<p>(4) "Modulation can never be the <em>end</em> of
music, since it is by its very nature a <em>means</em>
put <em>at the service of the musical idea</em>. Every
modulation which has not this character of
subordination to the idea is thereby inopportune,
useless, and even injurious to the equilibrium
of the composition."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Looking back at our examples in the light
of these principles, and especially with the
illumination afforded by the text in Kaito's
contrast of death and life, we shall find a
further element of art to admire in them&mdash;their
expressive use of modulation. The slow
movement of the symphony begins in the
comparatively "dark" key of D flat, but
touches in the fourth measure, at the acme of
the climax, the brighter D major, whence with
the waning emotion it subsides to the original
key. The passage cited from the <cite>Chant
élégiaque</cite> emerges from the shades of E flat
minor to the bright daylight of E major
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
(wherein starts a new statement of the main
theme). The fragment from "Souvenirs"
commences in quiet grief, in the clear but
rather subdued key of A minor; with the third
measure a downward inflection, a sort of depression
of mood, sinks it to hopeless groping
in the glooms of G flat and C flat, whence it
again struggles forth to new assertion, in A
minor, in the phrase that follows our excerpt.
Stated in bald technical terms like these,
such changes may seem crude, obvious, mechanical;
but anyone who will listen sympathetically
to the music in which they are embodied
by a master will realize the infinite
variety and subtlety of their appeal.</p>

<p>A later appearance of this same theme in
"Souvenirs," in which for the first two notes
in the second measure is substituted a triplet,
F, G, E, suggests the further remark that even
ornament, so apt to be used merely for show,
is employed by d'Indy, like so many more
basic resources, singly for expression. His
somewhat severe conception of art&mdash;there is
much in his style that, especially in contrast
with German sensuousness, is austere, bare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
almost stark&mdash;leads him to condemn superficial
decoration. "The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fioriture</i> of the Italian
dramatic school of the early nineteenth
century," he insists, "intended only to display
the vocal agility of the singer (just as the
Variation of Chopin, although more musical,
puts forward the fingers of the pianist), this
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fioriture</i>, consisting usually of embroideries
about an arpeggio, is truly more harmonic
than melodic&mdash;and even the harmony is
usually extremely banal. The characteristic
of the accomplished and conscientious
artist is a firm will to treat only subjects
that have a value in themselves, not borrowed
from the apparel in which they are
dressed up."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> And he elsewhere succinctly
defines the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fioriture</i> as "that art which
consists in making heard the greatest number
of useless notes in the shortest space of
time."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But he takes pains to distinguish
"this surcharge dictated by bad taste" from
the more essential ornament used in the "expressive
vocalises of J. S. Bach and his contemporaries,
which, like the Gregorian Variation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
from which they derive, form a part
of the melody." And he cites with approval
melodies like the theme of the Allegretto in
Franck's Symphony, in which a short phrase
is repeated not literally but with ornamental
variation resulting from the natural progression
of the thought or feeling&mdash;from what,
in short, we have called the logic of emotion.
Such treatment is almost a mannerism in his
own work. Other instances, besides the place
in "Souvenirs" just cited, are the first theme
of the violin sonata, the fugato in the first
movement of the quartet, the main theme of
the same movement, and the main theme of
"Evening" in the "Summer Day on the
Mountain" (Figure XXVII, <em>a</em>).</p>

<p>Finally, even in the matter of orchestration,
the least essential of any we have considered,
d'Indy is still guided by the same principle&mdash;truth
to feeling. Though universally acknowledged,
even by those who dislike his
music, to be one of the greatest living masters
of the resources of the orchestra, he never
uses these resources, as does for example
Rimsky-Korsakoff, in a spirit of sheer virtuosity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Nothing in his scores is put there to
dazzle or to stun; all is for eloquent musical
speech; and when there is great liveliness or
brilliancy, as there often is&mdash;at the end of
"Istar," for instance, in the scherzo of the
B-flat symphony, and in "Dawn" of the
"Summer Day on the Mountain"&mdash;it is in
response not to an opportunity for display,
but to a mood. The sharp contrast of the
general method of scoring with Wagner's,
especially in a composer so largely indebted
to Wagner, is highly instructive in this regard.
Wagner in his love of rich sonorities almost
habitually doubles different groups of instruments
on a single melody; d'Indy prefers the
single group, not only for its superior clarity
but even more, one must think, for the greater
eloquence of its individual voice. The passage
quoted from the symphony is a good
sample of his methods. First violins on their
G strings for the opening phrase, sounding at
once the right note of earnestness. Bass
clarinet alone on motive <em>b</em>. Both first and
second violins for the more emphatic repetition
of the main motive, and the low strings in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
their more impassioned accents for the reiteration
of the bass clarinet phrase. Then all
the violins and the violas for the third, culminating
statement,&mdash;the first violins leaving
off with the B flat, the seconds with the A,
and the violas, in their more veiled tones, alone
carrying the phrase down to its final A flat.</p>

<p>Thus does d'Indy use the various elements
of musical technique&mdash;melody, rhythm,
harmony, modulation, and even ornament
and orchestration&mdash;in the interests of emotion.
Before asking whether the same
principle that we thus see so multifariously
at work in short sections of his music
can also be traced in the marshaling of its
larger masses, let us take one final example
of its operation within conveniently narrow
limits. In Figure XXV (pages 198, 199) is
shown the coda of the first movement of the
string quartet in E major, his masterpiece in
chamber music. It is entirely derived from
the fragment of Gregorian chant used as a text.
We may note summarily the following points,
which by no means exhaust the interest of the
passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

Coda of the first movement of the String Quartet in E, opus 45
(1897), based on the fragment from a Gregorian chant:</p>
</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p198-199.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>1. Melodic. There is no salient phrase
which is not derived from the root motive.
As for the variety, the reader will judge for
himself. This is a supreme case of the germinating
power of a musical thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Rhythmic. The original nucleus of the
theme is rhythmed mainly in quarter notes.
It is reduced to even eighth notes at the beginning
of the coda, and in that murmuring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
inconspicuous form stays on a dead level, so
to speak, and makes a colorless background
of accompaniment whence the more passionate
main phrases detach themselves sharply.
Beginning in the fifth measure the second
violin sounds an <em>augmented</em> form of the motive
(whole notes), in expression tentative, timid.
This recurs in the viola in measure 11, with
more of emphasis, and is broken in upon by a
<em>syncopated</em> form of the same (beginning on the
second half of the measure) from the first
violin. The C sharp here is the crest of the
emotional wave, whence it subsides first by
the gradual descent of the motive through
three octaves in measures 17-20, and then by
the flagging of the accompaniment rhythm
first to quarter notes, then to half notes. Still
a different rhythm is heard in the last announcement
by the first violin.</p>

<p>3. Harmonic. The harmony is absolutely
the product of concurrent melodies throughout.
No notes are added merely for color.
Yet the sonorities, though effects rather than
causes, are unforgettable.</p>

<p>4. Modulatory. The first measure strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
establishes E major as the tonal center, and
as the goal of what preceded the excerpt. A
subtle change of the violin figure obscures the
sense of tonality (by suggesting the atonal
"whole-tone scale"), whereupon the first
meditative version of the theme appears in
the much darker key of A flat. The tonality
is again clouded, and the theme appears once
more in A, brighter than A flat, but less bright
than the original E. The reappearance of
this therefore, in the fifteenth measure, has
the effect of an "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</i>." The tonic
of E major is maintained through the last
eleven measures, giving a grateful sense of
homecoming, of repose after adventure.</p>

<p>5. Instrumental. The student is referred
to the score for detail. Particularly notable
are the keenness of the violin E string at the
moment of climax, and the earnest virility of
the G string in the last statement.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The same loyalty to emotional truth that
dictates all these processes of detail, guides
also d'Indy's treatment of a composition considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
as a whole. His conception of form,
though set forth in the <cite>Cours</cite> in largely intellectual
terms, can be thoroughly understood
only when traced back to its emotional
basis. Because for him a piece of music must
hang together emotionally, must proceed, that
is, all from a few ideas, and must evolve these
freely and variously in obedience to the logic
of emotion, he takes as his central principle
Variation, or germination from root themes.
Not only, he believes, should the single movement
thus proceed from a few themes, but
the entire work, according to what is called
cyclic form, should result from their transformation
and recombination. In other words,
just as the rhythmic waxing and waning
of the emotions embodied in a few themes
gives rise to the single movement, the regarding
of the same themes <em>from different points of
view</em>, or under the domination of varying moods,
will naturally generate the contrasted movements,
all thematically related, of cyclic form.</p>

<p>It may at once be admitted that such a
conception of form has its pitfalls. The
same process that in the glow of creative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
emotion is a spontaneous reshaping of a theme
to meet a new situation may in the absence
of such emotion degenerate into a hammering
of recalcitrant matter into mere distortion
and ineptitude. That is what we note too
often in Liszt's similar theme transformations
in his symphonic poems, as when in
"Les Préludes" he makes his love <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cantabile</i>
do reluctant duty as a trumpet call to war.
D'Indy, let us confess it, is by no means guiltless
on this score; in uninspired moments he
becomes too easily the slave instead of the
master of his process; living form stiffens into
dead formula; and we have a more or less
mechanical rearrangement of notes, as for
instance that of the main theme of the finale
in the B flat Symphony, based on the choral
at the end, masquerading as a genuine reincarnation.
Such scholastic passages do indeed
appear as blemishes in too many even of
his finest works. But it is fair to judge a process
not by its occasional abuse, but by the
possibilities a felicitous use of it opens up.
These possibilities in the case of cyclic form
are a maximum of diversity without diffuseness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and a maximum of unity without monotony
or platitude.</p>

<p>That a development of something of the
sort was indispensable to the progress of composition
is evident when we reflect how intolerable
literal recapitulation has become to
the modern ear. Much of the prejudice against
the sonata form in our day is due to the literal
recapitulations of bunglers in the use of it.
The remedy is, not to throw overboard the
form, which is a natural, flexible, and convenient
one, but to bring to it a freshness of
feeling which penetrates at once to the spirit
of it, ignoring the letter. Thus d'Indy, in
the slow movement of the B flat Symphony,
recapitulates the main theme, shown at Figure
XXVI, <em>a</em>, not literally but in subtlest reincarnation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
one step higher in the scale, though
still in the same key, and transferred from the
sultry tones of clarinet, horn, English horn,
and viola to the pure, pale sonority of a single
flute, supported by lightest violin harmonies
(Figure XXVI, <em>b</em>). It is the same theme, but
breathing now a quite new sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It is but a step from such a recreated recapitulation
to a theme transformation such
as we find in the last movement of the "Summer
Day on the Mountain." This work is
not only its composer's masterpiece in the

best of a whole series of works<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in which he
has expressed his love of his native country of
the Cévennes in southeastern France. "At
this moment," he once wrote in a letter from
his château of Faugs, near Boffres in Ardèche,
"I see the snowy summits of the Alps, the
nearer mountains, the plain of the Rhone, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
pine woods that I know so well, and the green,
rich harvest which has not yet been gathered.
It is a true pleasure to be here after the labors
and the vexations of the winter. What they
call at Paris 'the artistic world' seems afar
off and a trifling thing. Here is true repose,
here one feels at the true source of all art."</p>

<p>The "Jour d'Été à la Montagne," in three
movements, "Aurore" ("Dawn"), "Jour&mdash;Après-midi
sous les pins" ("Day: Afternoon
under the Pines") and "Soir" ("Evening"),
is characteristic of the composer in that,
despite its program, there is in it little scene-painting,
such as we find so constantly in
Strauss and others. A memorable suggestion
of dawn, with its vague shapes in the half-light
and its bird songs, in the first movement<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>;
a whiff of peasant dance-tune in the second,
coming up through the baking heat under the
pines; in the third some evening chimes from
the valley: that is all. It is the emotional
significance of the scene in its varying aspects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
its appeal to the sympathies and associations
of a poetic observer, that interest the musician.
The main theme of the last movement (Figure
XXVII, <em>a</em>) thus suggests the joy of life in the
bright summer afternoon; its activity depicts
no mere external scene, we feel, but reflects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the elation of the sensitive heart, witnessing
this scene. And when, at the end, after the
suggestions of descending night and the distant
jangle of chimes tempered by the evening
air, the same melody returns in softest sonorities
of strings and in quietest motion (Figure
XXVII, <em>b</em>), we hear in it again no merely
objective facts, but the tranquil evening
thoughts of a poet, spiritualized in meditation.
Never since he first essayed such theme transformation
in a large work, in the "Symphony
on a Mountain Theme" of 1886, which M. Paul
Dukas called "a single piece in three episodes,"
has d'Indy been more successful in drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
together the most opposing moods by the
single subjective point of view from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
they are regarded, as incarnated in a common
theme. Never has he written a more characteristic
page than that lovely breath of
evening tenderness, the meditation of a lover
on the world toward which darkness and sleep
gently approach.</p>

<p>A work in which the cyclic method is applied
with almost unparalleled rigor and resourcefulness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and which is therefore worthy
of detailed analysis, is the String Quartet in E
major,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> built up from four notes of a Gregorian
chant, shown at Figure XXV. The
swinging main theme of the first movement,
derived from this fragment by a natural rhythmic
and tonal proliferation (see Figure XXVIII,
<em>b</em>), is not immediately stated, but is rather
anticipated tentatively, and gradually allowed
to take shape, by a process dear to the composer,
first through imitative bits for the different
instruments and then through a serious
fugato (Figure XXVIII, <em>a</em>). Once achieved it
is broadly treated, with a richly conceived tonal
digression into E flat major and return. A
second theme, of sinuous curve and fluent
movement (Figure XXVIII, <em>c</em>), is reached
through a transition passage of more animated
rhythm. The themes thus stated, development
begins: not a perfunctory worrying of
the themes such as the "free fantasia" often
degenerates into in the hands of composers
possessed of neither freedom nor fancy, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
dynamic action and reaction of the themes
such as d'Indy conceives development essentially
to be. "Development," he says, "is
... the action of the themes and ideas, and
consequently their reason for being, since an
idea is of value only through the action it is
capable of exercising. When there are several
ideas ... the development expresses usually
all the phases of a struggle between them,
with the final triumph of one and submission
of the other.... The themes comport themselves
like living people: they act and move
according to their tendencies, their sentiments,
and their passions. These modifications show
themselves both in the thematic elements which
are elaborated as if to surpass themselves, or
are restrained as if to become absorbed, and in
the tonal trajectories which orient themselves
toward light or toward darkness."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> It will be
seen that in this case the development first
(pages 9 and 10) takes the aspect of a quiet
presentation of the first theme in dark keys
(E flat major, etc.) and then (from index
number 10, through the whole of page 11) of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a brief recurrence of the second theme and
elimination of it with the reviving force of
the first, moving through more energetic
rhythms and brighter tonalities to final victorious
reassertion. The themes are then recapitulated
and the movement ends with the
beautiful coda we have already examined.</p>

<p>The two middle movements, too complex to
analyze in detail, are based on themes strikingly
illustrative of what was said a moment
ago as to cyclic form arising from the approach
to a common theme from different angles, or
under the influence of varying moods. That
of the scherzo is the theme envisaged playfully
(Figure XXVIII, <em>d</em>); that of the slow movement
(Figure XXVIII, <em>e</em>) shapes itself in
response to a more serious contemplation. It
may be pointed out that these are no mere
clever or learned jugglings with notes, such as
arise sometimes from the abuse of the method;
not only are they true textually to the theme,
but each is a faithful expression of its own
mood; the resulting music accordingly convinces
us emotionally as well as intellectually.</p>

<p>The finale is a piece of writing extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
for the manifold resources developed out of the
original theme, for the bold ingenuity of its
polyphonic and rhythmic combinations, and
for the variety of its emotional content. Its
main theme comes from the original motive
by <em>inversion</em> (Figure XXIX, <em>a</em>), and derives a
certain amplitude from its three half-note
rhythm proceeding deliberately against the
more agitated two-four of other parts (especially
the viola, at first, with a persistent
figure taken also from the theme). Its second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
theme also traces its ancestry back to the
first movement, but in a more elusive way; a
comparison of Figure XXIX, <em>b</em>, with Figure
XXVIII, <em>c</em>, will reveal the connection. The
elaboration of these themes, and of the quaint
staccato bridge passage between them, leads
to most unexpected combinations. The fugato
of the first movement reappears, but now
<em>inverted</em> (Figure XXIX, <em>c</em>). At the top of
page 58 we find the main theme in the second
violin answered canonically by the viola,
while the first violin sustains, high above, the
original motive. Finally, after the themes
have met all manner of vicissitudes and wandered
through all sorts of keys, the original
motive in its most conclusive form brings the
final cadence in E major.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A last illustration, in some ways the most
striking of all, of d'Indy's conviction that
emotional expressiveness is the criterion of the
value of all artistic processes, is afforded by his
attitude toward the peculiar idiom that has
been developed by Debussy, Ravel, and others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and particularly toward the system of harmony
based on the "whole-tone scale." His
standpoint here is that of the open-minded
and curious artist toward processes that may
have new possibilities, saved from faddishness
by a thorough familiarity with traditional
resources and an indifference to novelty for
mere novelty's sake. He has thus won the
distinction of being blamed by the academic
for "queerness," harshness, and obscurity, at
the same time that he is patronized as reactionary
by the "ultras."</p>

</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p218.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>The evidence of his works is that he makes
free use of the whole-tone scale, as of all other
technical elements, so far as it lends itself
to the expression he has in mind, but no
farther. There are already traces of it in
certain passages of the early Clarinet Trio
(1887) where he wishes to give a sense of
groping uncertainty. In "Fervaal" (1895) its
peculiar coloring is skilfully used in a number
of passages, as, for example, that of the two
bucklers, and its vigor and brilliancy, which
so commended it to Moussorgsky in "Boris
Godunoff," are exploited in the passage before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the apparition of the cloud figures (see Figure
XXX, <em>a</em>). In "Istar" a similar use is made of
it for the calls which announce Istar's arrival
at the different doors; to it is due a large measure
of the mystical expression of the B flat
Symphony, especially of the opening bass motive
(Figure XXX, <em>b</em>) founded on the tritone
which used to be regarded as "<em>diabolus in
musica</em>," while the middle section of the
scherzo draws upon its power of suspending

<p>But d'Indy is too sound an artist to lend
himself to the abuse of any process, however
fashionable, and he has the good sense to
recognize the dangers of the whole-tone scale.
In none of his critical writings has he expressed
himself more courageously and at the
same time more fairly, than in an article on
"Good Sense"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> in which he takes up this
much-disputed matter.</p>

<p>"In the nineteenth century," he says, "some
Russian composers, in the interest of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
special effects, employed the scale of whole
tones, which one may name atonal because
it suppresses all possibility of modulation.
In the twentieth century Claude Debussy and
Maurice Ravel elaborated these methods,
making often very ingenious applications of
them; but they made the mistake (one must
dare to speak the truth of those one esteems)
of erecting processes into principles, or at least
of letting them be so erected by their muftis,
so that the formula now established by fashion
is: 'Outside of harmonic sensation and the
titillation of orchestral timbres there is no
salvation.'</p>

<p>"This formula is dangerous, because far from
constituting an advance it results in a retrogression
of our art, and leads us backward
by a hundred years. What these prophets
try to establish is the rule of sense to the
exclusion of sentiment, it is the supremacy of
sensation over the equilibrium of the heart
and the intelligence. This sensualist movement
is neither new nor original. About a
hundred years ago a similar aberration of
good sense tried to poison our music. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
epoch of the Rossinis and the Donizettis the
sensualist formula was 'All for and by melody!'
To-day it is 'All for and by harmony!' I
should say however that, of the two maladies,
the second is less grave, for nothing is more
ephemeral than new harmonies, if they do not
take their point of departure from the two
other elements of music: melody and rhythm....
In order that harmony should be durable,
it must constitute, not mere glistening
surface, mere tapestry, but rather the clothing
of the living and acting being which is
the <em>rhythmed melody</em>. The costume, in this
case, may safely pass out of style&mdash;the human
person, if it is well constituted, will endure.</p>

<p>"The scale of whole tones is far from being
an improvement on our traditional occidental
scale, since it suppresses all tonality and hence
all modulation. Now, change of tonal place
by modulation is one of the most precious
elements of expression. To deprive oneself
of it systematically is therefore a retrogression
toward the barbaric monotony of past ages.</p>

<p>"What, then, does good sense demand?
It demands very simple things&mdash;that the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
composer should begin by learning his art,
and should not allow himself to be hypnotized
by a process that happens to be in fashion,
employed fruitfully, to be sure, by certain
natures, but not constituting in itself the whole
of musical art.</p>

<p>"All processes are good, on condition that
they never become the principal end, and are
regarded only as means to make MUSIC."</p>

<p>The candor, courage, and penetration of
such criticism as this, shown, though seldom
in quite such measure, in every critical page
that d'Indy has written, and the uncompromising
nature of his views, not always free from
narrowness, have of course made him many
enemies. Probably no man in modern music
is better loved or better hated. The devotion
of his whole life to art, with a modesty, a suppression
of self, a really religious enthusiasm
rare in musicians, has naturally turned the
love of his pupils and disciples into something
that is almost worship; and this has in turn
naturally enough irritated, sometimes to exasperation,
those who vent their disgust of artistic
idolatries on the often innocent idol, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
who feel keenly, in a hero, the limitations of
which no human being is free, or who find
especially antipathetic, in M. d'Indy's case,
certain temperamental leanings which he could
not overcome if he would, such as those to
conservatism, aristocracy, and even chauvinism
in social relations, and to the strictest Roman
Catholicism in religion.</p>

<p>Indeed, regarded simply as an intellect,
d'Indy is something of a paradox, moments
of the most penetrative insight alternating
unaccountably in him with fits of prejudice or
narrowness that suggest the existence upon
his mental retina of incurable blind spots.
What could be more illuminating in their unconventionality
than such judgments as these,
for example:&mdash;Of Schumann: "A genius in
short and simple works, he finds himself lost
when he has to build a musical monument.
He then lets himself be guided by sentiment
alone, and in spite of his often very fine ideas
he can only <em>improvise</em> works of limited range,
hasty fruits of an art not sufficiently conscious."
Of Mendelssohn:&mdash;"Always skilful
in appropriating the knowledge of others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the Jews are seldom, true artists by nature."
Of Grieg: "His short inspiration and his absolute
ignorance of composition render him entirely
inept in the construction of symphonic
works; he produces then only hybrid assemblages
of short fragments, unskilfully welded
together or simply juxtaposed, without appearance
of order or unity either in conception
or in execution."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But the fastidiousness
already verging here on the finical seems always
to be in danger, in dealing with subjects
on which he has active prejudices, such as
Jews, Protestants, free thinkers, and modern
Germans, of overshooting its mark, losing the
sense of proportion, and becoming narrowly
sectarian. Someone once said of him that
he had the spirit of the mediæval religious
fanatics, and had he lived in the Middle Ages
would have been burned at the stake for his
convictions, or would have burned others, as
the case might be, with equal ardor.</p>

<p>One thus catches sometimes a note of intolerance,
almost of superstition, even in some
of his most valid judgments, putting one a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
little on guard, perhaps rather by what is
omitted or implied than by what is actually
said. Thus Bach is great, "not because of,
but in spite of, the dogmatic and withering
spirit of the Reformation,"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and Franck's
comment on Kant's "Critique of Pure
Reason," that it was "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très amusant</i>," is
commended as one of the finest criticisms,
"coming from the mouth of the believing
French musician, that could be made of the
heavy and undigested critique of the German
philosopher."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Again "The present-day
symphonists of Germany seem totally incapable
of making anything great: they content
themselves with making it big, which is not
quite the same thing." They are charged
with "total absence of artistic taste, misunderstanding
of all proportion and of all
tonal order."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> They are "almost devoid of
musical taste; they cannot distinguish good
music from bad; the opinion of a German on
a musical work has no importance."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
sympathy of the judicial with these pronouncements
wanes as they increase in animus;
the justice of the first, to which any
thoughtful musician could hardly take exception,
is obscured by the evident exaggeration
of the last; and musical criticism too
evidently loses itself in chauvinism.</p>

<p>We need not concern ourselves here to estimate
the exact proportion between wisdom
and prejudice in d'Indy's writings; the materials
for a judgment have been admirably set
forth in Rolland's essay, and each reader
may judge for himself. The aim of these
citations is rather to illustrate the temperament
of their author, and to show that in the
last analysis, even though these writings
make up perhaps the finest body of musical
criticism produced by a creative musician
since Schumann, that temperament is after all
originative rather than judicial. Much light
as there is in it, there is even more heat.
D'Indy is a crusader of beauty; the shining
spear is his natural weapon; and when he takes
to the clerk's ink-horn and balance sheet it is
always with a sort of youthful impatience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
He is essentially a poet, a maker; it is in his
music that he finds his truest self. Indeed, he
is too many-sided to be quite justly appreciated
by his contemporaries; the poet has
too much disappeared for us behind the
teacher, the scholar, the critic, the philosopher,
the devotee. On the occasion of the
revival of "Fervaal" in 1913, M. Vuillermoz
published an imaginary talk of this composite
d'Indy to his adoring pupils, asking
them not to idealize him, to let him remain
human, to see in him the simple human lover,
like his Fervaal, which he felt himself to be.
It is time, for our own sakes, that we paid
more attention than we do to this human
lover that finds supreme expression in the
Symphony in B flat, in "Istar," in the E
major Quartet, in the "Jour d'Été à la Montagne."
He it is who speaks to the young
men, to his fellow lovers of immortal beauty,
to the future. For, as one of his most understanding
critics, Louis Laloy, has written of
him: "Emotion is queen, and science is her
servant." If d'Indy has studied as few modern
musicians have studied, if he has drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
on the past for his ample means, it has been
only in order to take more beauty with him,
and to enable us to take it, into the future;
and for all his intellectual power he has never
forgotten that "Only the heart can engender
beauty."</p>

<h2>VI<br />
<br />
<small>MUSIC IN AMERICA</small></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>In the discussions of "American
music" that go on perennially in
our newspapers and journals, now
waxing in a wave of patriotic enthusiasm,
now waning as popular
attention is turned to something else, in war
time much stimulated by an enhanced consciousness
of nationality (unless indeed they
are totally elbowed aside to make room for
more immediate subjects), a sharp cleavage
will usually be observed between those whose
interest is primarily in the music for itself,
wherever it comes from, and those in whom
artistic considerations give way before patriotic
ardor, and propaganda usurp the place
of discrimination. One group, in uttering
the challenging phrase, "American music,"
places the stress instinctively on the noun
and regards the adjective as only qualification;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the other, in its preoccupation with "American,"
seems to take "music" rather for
granted. Unfortunately the former group
constitutes so small a minority, and expresses
itself so soberly, that its wholesome insistence
on the quality of the article itself is likely to be
quite drowned out by the bawling of the
advertisers, with their insistent slogan "Made
in America." All the advantages of numbers,
organization, and easy appeal to the man in
the street are theirs. Even if we ignore those
venal music journals which make a system of
exploiting the patriotism of the undiscriminating
for purely pecuniary purposes, there remain
enough enthusiasts and propagandists, indisposed
or unable to appraise quality for themselves,
to create by their "booming" methods a
formidable confusion in our standards of taste.
Inasmuch, therefore, as we are condemned, for
our sins, to be not only producers but consumers
of this "American music," it behooves
us to make careful inspection of the claims for
it so extravagantly put forth, and to assure
ourselves that we are getting something besides
labels for our money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>What, then, is the precise value we ought
justly to ascribe to that word "American"
as applied to music, and wherein have those
we may call champions of the adjective been
inclined to exaggerate it? If we analyze their
attitude, we shall find them the prey of two
fallacies which constantly falsify their conclusions,
and make them dangerous guides
for those who have at heart the real interests
of music in America. The first of these fallacies
is that which confuses quantity with
quality, and supposes that artistic excellence
can be decided by vote of the majority. The
second is that which identifies racial character
with local idioms and tricks of speech rather
than with a certain emotional and spiritual
temper. Both lead straight to the oft-repeated
conclusion that "ragtime" is the necessary
basis of our native musical art.</p>

<p>Listen, for example, to one of the most persistent,
courageous, and often interesting
advocates of ragtime, Mr. H. K. Moderwell.
"I can't help feeling," says Mr. Moderwell,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
"that a person who doesn't open his heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to ragtime somehow isn't human. Nine out
of ten musicians, if caught unawares, will
like this music until they remember that
they shouldn't. What does this mean? Does
it mean that ragtime is 'all very well in its
place'? Rather that these musicians don't
consider that place <em>theirs</em>. But that place,
remember, is in the affections of some 10,000,000
or more Americans. Conservative estimates
show that there are at least 50,000,000 copies
of popular music sold in this country yearly
and a goodly portion of it is in ragtime....
You may take it as certain that if many millions
of people persist in liking something that
has not been recognized by the schools, there
is vitality in that thing." No doubt there is,
just as by the same argument there is vitality
in chewing gum and the comic supplements.
The question is, of course, what sort of vitality?
Yet if you raise this question of quality, you
are immediately charged with being a "highbrow,"
"a person," in Professor Brander
Matthews's already classic definition, "educated
beyond his intelligence,"&mdash;a charge
from which any sane man naturally shrinks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
"The best American music is that which the
greatest number of Americans like; the greatest
number of Americans like ragtime; therefore
ragtime is the best American music." This
is a specious syllogism, which you may oppose
only at the risk of being thought a highbrow
and a snob.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that you really do not
happen to care for chewing gum, that just as
a matter of fact, of personal taste, and not
through any principles or sense of superiority
to your fellows you prefer other forms of
nutriment or exercise. You confess this peculiarity.
Can you not hear the reproachful
reply? "I can't help feeling that a person
who doesn't open his heart to chewing gum
somehow isn't human. Nine out of ten
travelers on the subway, if caught unawares
[with gum disguised as bonbons, let us say]
will like it until they remember that they
shouldn't. What does this mean? Does it
mean that chewing gum is 'all very well in
its place'? Rather that these punctilious
people don't consider that place <em>theirs</em>. But
that place, remember, is in the affections of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
some 10,000,000 or more Americans. The
annual output of the chief chewing gum manufacturers"&mdash;etc.,
etc. Thus are you voted
down if you happen to be in the minority.
It does you no good to protest that you are
really quite sincere and without desire to
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">épater le bourgeois</i>; that you can't help preferring
Mr. Howells's novels to Mr. Robert
W. Chambers's, Mr. Ben Foster's landscapes
to Mr. Christy's magazine girls, Mr. Irwin's
"Nautical Lays of a Landsman" to the comic
supplements, and MacDowell's "To a Wild
Rose" to "Everybody's Doing It." If you
stray from the herd you must be sick. If you
vote for the losers you must be a snob.</p>

<p>Such charges are the more dangerous in
that they sometimes contain a half-truth.
There is a kind of person, the simon-pure snob,
who casts his vote for the loser just because he
is a loser, because he is unpopular, who prides
himself on his "exclusiveness," "excluding
himself," as Thoreau penetratively says,
"from all that is worth while." His is a sort
of inverted numericalism, based on quantity
just as essentially as the crude gospel of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
"10,000,000 or more Americans," but on quantity
negative and vanishing towards the zero
of perfect distinction. It is from his kind
that are recruited the faddists, those who
"dote on Debussy," the devotees of folk-songs
not for their human beauty but as curious
specimens, those who invent all sorts of
queer connections between music and painting
or poetry, and indeed seem to find in it
anything and everything but simple human
feeling. It is not from these that we shall
get any help towards the truth about ragtime.
Indeed, they seem because of their unsympathetic
attitude toward the spirit of music&mdash;its
emotional expression&mdash;and their preoccupation
with the letter of it, to be especially
susceptible to the second fallacy of which we
spoke&mdash;that of identifying racial quality with
mere idiom rather than with fundamental
temper.</p>

<p>Mr. Moderwell shall be spokesman of this
view also. "You can't tell an American composer's
'art-song,'" he says, "from any mediocre
art-song the world over.... You can
distinguish American ragtime from the popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
music of any nation and any age." Let
us agree heartily that the mediocre "art-song"
(horrid name for a desolating thing)
is probably no better and no worse in our own
than in other countries. Does this not seem
an insufficient warrant for the excellence of
types of art that can be more easily told
apart? For purposes of labeling specimens
earmarks are an advantage, but hardly for
appraising modes of expression. If the important
matter in American music is not its
expression of the American temper, but the
peculiar technical feature, the special kind of
syncopation we call the "rag rhythm," then
the important matter in Hungarian music is
not its fire but its "sharp fourth step." Beethoven
ceases to be Teutonic when he uses
Irish cadences in his Seventh Symphony,
and Chopin is Polish only in his mazurkas and
polonaises. Of course this will not do; and
Mr. Moderwell, to do him justice, after remarking
that "ragtime is not merely syncopation&mdash;it
is a certain sort of syncopation,"
adds "But of course this definition is
not enough. Ragtime has its flavor that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
definition can imprison." Our ultimate question
is, then, not how many people like ragtime,
or how few like it, or how easily can
its idiom be told from other idioms, but how
expressive is it of the American temper, how
full an artistic utterance can it give of the best
and widest American natures? This is a question
not of quantity but of quality: of the
quality of ragtime, the quality of America,
and the adequacy of the one to the other.</p>

<p>Suppose, bearing in mind Mr. Moderwell's
warning against snobbery, that "A Russian
folk-song was no less scorned in the court of
Catherine the Great than a ragtime song in
our music studios to-day," we examine in
some detail a typical example of ragtime such
as "The Memphis Blues," of which he assures
us that "In sheer melodic beauty, in the
vividness of its characterization, in the deftness
of its polyphony and structure, this
song deserves to rank among the best of our
time."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Here are the opening strains of it.</p>

<p>Approaching them with the eager expectation
that such praise naturally arouses, can we, as
candid lovers of music, find anything but
bitter disappointment in their trivial, poverty-stricken,
threadbare conventionality? How
many thousand times have we heard that
speciously cajoling descent of the first three
notes, that originally piquant but now indescribably
boresome oscillation from the tonic
chord in the third measure? These are the
common snippets and tag-ends of harmony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
kicked about the very gutters, ground out
by every hurdy-gurdy, familiarity with which
breeds not affection but contempt. Their
very surface cleverness, as of meaningless
ornament, is a part of their offense. Russian
folk-song indeed! Compare them with
the simple but noble tonic, dominant and
sub-dominant, of the "Volga Boat Song" and
their shoddiness stands self-revealed. And
the melody? Bits and snippets again, quite
without character if it were not for the rhythm,
and acquiring no momentum save in the lines
"I went out a-dancin'," etc., where they build
up well, but to a complete anticlimax in the
return of the obvious opening strain.</p>

<p>As for the rag rhythm itself, the sole distinctive
feature of this music, it has undoubtedly
something of real piquancy. The
trick, it will be noted, is a syncopation of half-beats,
arranged so as to pull bodily forward
certain comparatively strong accents, those
at the middle of the measures<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>&mdash;a scheme to
which words as well as melody conform. The
left hand meanwhile gives the regular metrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
division of the measure, and a writer in the
London Times, defining ragtime as "a strongly
syncopated melody superimposed on a strictly
regular accompaniment," points out that "it
is the combination of these two rhythms
that gives 'ragtime' its character."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This
is perhaps not strictly true, since in some
of the most effective bits of ragtime the
metrical pulsation may give way momentarily
to the syncopation, and everyone remembers
those delightful times of complete
silence in which the pulse is kept going mentally,
to be finally confirmed by a crashing
cadence. But it is usually the case that both
time schemes, metrical and rhythmical, are
maintained together. For this very reason
we must question the contention of the champions
of ragtime that its type of syncopation
is capable of great variety, a contention in
support of which some of them have even
challenged comparison of it with the rhythmic
vigors of Beethoven and Schumann.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The subtlety of syncopation as an artistic
device results from its simultaneous maintenance
of two time-patterns, the rhythmic
and the metrical, in such a relation that the
second and subordinate one, though never
lost sight of, is never obtruded. The quasi-mechanical
pulse of the meter is the indispensable
background against which only can the
freer oscillations of the rhythm outline themselves.
The moment the sense of it is lost,
as it is sometimes lost in those over-bold
passages of Schumann where a displacement
is too emphatically made or too long continued,
the charm disappears. In the following
from his "Faschingsschwank," for instance,
the interest of the rhythmic accent on
beat "three" lasts only so long as we oppose to
it mentally a regular metric accent on "one."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p243.jpg" width="500" height="160" alt="imp243" />
<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Figure XXXII.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>In the continuation of the passage, for
which the reader is referred to the original,
our minds are apt to "slip a stitch," so to
speak, letting "three" and "one" coalesce.
The moment this happens the passage becomes
commonplace. But suppose, on the
other hand, in the effort to maintain our sense
of the meter, we strike the bass notes on each
"one." Now equally, or indeed more than
before, the charm is fled, and the passage
rendered stale and unprofitable, through the
actual presentation to the ear of so mechanical
a reiteration. In short, the metrical
scheme has to be mentally maintained, but
actually, so far as possible, eliminated. Looking
back, in the light of these considerations,
at "The Memphis Blues," we shall realize
that whatever the pleasing eccentricity of the
rhythm, so relentless a meter as we here find
thumped out by the left hand cannot but
quickly grow tiresome, as indeed it will be felt
to be after a few repetitions.</p>

<p>Reference to another well-known theme
of Schumann will reveal a further weakness
of ragtime. The second theme of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
finale of his Concerto for piano runs as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/score_p245.jpg" width="500" height="268" alt="imp245" />
<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Figure XXXIII.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="center ebhide" style="margin-bottom: 2em; "><a href="music/score_p245.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p>Here the indescribably delightful effect is evidently
due not only to the purely rhythmic
syncopation, but also to the fact that on the
silent strong beat of every second measure
harmony and melody as well as rhythm are so
to speak "tied up," or suspended, in such a
way that the syncopation is at the very heart
of the whole musical conception, and cannot
be omitted without annihilating the music.
Beside such essential syncopation as this the
mere pulling forward of certain notes, as in
"The Memphis Blues," is seen to be superficial,
an arbitrary dislocation which may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
disguise but cannot correct the triteness of
the real melodic line. In fact, we seem here
to have tracked ragtime to its lair and discovered
what it really is. It is no creative
process, like the syncopation of the masters,
by which are struck forth new, vigorous,
and self-sufficing forms. It is a rule of thumb
for putting a "kink" into a tune that without
such specious rehabilitation would be unbearable.
It is not a new flavor, but a kind
of curry or catsup strong enough to make the
stale old dishes palatable to unfastidious appetites.
Significant is it that, as the writer
in the Times remarks, "In American slang to
'rag' a melody is to syncopate a normally
regular time." The "rag" idiom can thus be
put on and off like a mask; and in recent years
we have seen thus grotesquely disguised, as
the Mendelssohn Wedding March, for instance,
in "No Wedding Bells for Me," many familiar
melodies. To these it can give no new musical
lineaments, but only distort the old ones as
with St. Vitus' dance.</p>

<p>Thus the technical limitations of ragtime
which we have tried to analyze are seen to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in the last analysis the results and indices of a
more fundamental shortcoming&mdash;an emotional
superficiality and triviality peculiar to it.
Ragtime is the musical expression of an attitude
toward life only too familiar to us all,
an attitude shallow, restless, avid of excitement,
incapable of sustained attention, skimming
the surface of everything, finding nowhere
satisfaction, realization, or repose. It is a
meaningless stir-about, a commotion without
purpose, an epilepsy simulating controlled
muscular action. It is the musical counterpart
of the sterile cleverness we find in so
much of our contemporary conversation, as
well as in our theater and our books. No
candid observer could deny the prominence in
our American life of this restlessness of which
ragtime is one expression. It is undoubtedly
what most strikes superficial observation. The
question is whether it is really representative
of the American temper as a whole, or is
prominent only as the froth is prominent
on a glass of beer. Mr. Moderwell thinks
the former: "I like to think," he says, "that
ragtime is the perfect expression of the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
city, with its restless bustle and motion,
its multitude of unrelated details, and its
underlying rhythmic progress toward a vague
somewhere." "As you walk up and down the
streets of an American city you feel in its
jerk and rattle a personality different from that
of any European capital.... This is American.
Ragtime, I believe, expresses it. It is
to-day the one true American music."</p>

<p>To such an idolatry of precisely the most
hideous, inhuman, and disheartening features
in our national and musical life a lover of
music and a lover of America can only reply
that, first, it is possible that America lies less
on the surface than we think, possible that it
is no more adequately represented by Broadway
than France is represented by the Parisian
boulevards, or England by the London
music halls; but that, second, if indeed the
land of Lincoln and of Emerson has degenerated
until nothing remains of it but "jerk
and rattle," then we at least are free to repudiate
the false patriotism of "My country,
right or wrong," to insist that better than
bad music is no music, and to let our beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
art subside finally under the clangor of subway
gongs and automobile horns, dead but not
dishonored.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That type of musical æsthetic which insists
much on the importance of the racial and
national differences dividing human kind into
groups, and of the special features, technical
and expressive, characterizing the music of
these various groups, is constantly challenging
our American music to disavow what it
calls a featureless cosmopolitanism, and to
achieve individuality by idealizing some primitive
popular strain, whether of the Indians, of
the negroes, of the British colonizers, or of
our contemporary "ragtime." In so doing it
usually accepts uncritically certain assumptions.
It is apt to assume, for instance, that
interpretative truth is assured by geographical
propinquity. The chant of the Indian "expresses"
the modern American because the
habitat of both is west of the Atlantic Ocean.
It often assumes that characteristic turns of
idiom, such as certain modal intervals or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
rhythmic figures, are of intrinsic value as making
music "distinctive." You can make a
tune "American" by "ragging" its rhythm,
as you make a story American by inserting
"I guess" or "I reckon" at frequent intervals.
It often mistakes the conception of the average
for that of the ideal type, and supposes that
the man in the street represents the best taste
of America. Above all, it condemns any
attempt at universalizing artistic utterance as
"featureless cosmopolitanism" or "flabby eclecticism,"
and suggests that the musician who
speaks, not a dialect but a language understood
over the civilized world (as Tschaikowsky did,
for example, to the disgust of the Russian
nationalists), has "lost contact," as the phrase
goes, "with the soil." In the interest of clear
thinking all these assumptions stand in need of
criticism.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible even to state the first
without recognizing the large measure of absurdity
it contains. That the crude war-dances
and chants of the red aborigines of this
continent should be in any way representative
of so mixed a people, compounded of so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
European strains, as we who have exterminated
and displaced them, is a thought more worthy
of savages who believe that the strength of
their enemy passes into them when they eat
him than of our vaunted intelligence, fortified
by ethnological science. We should hardly
entertain it if we were not misled by the interest
that attaches to anything unusual or outlandish,
and tempted by certain idiomatic peculiarities
of these monotonous strains to exploit their
"local color." This may very well be done
now and then for an artistic holiday, as MacDowell
has done it in his Indian Suite; but
if a folk-music is to enter vitally into art it
must bring with it something more than
quaintness or distinctive idioms, it must be
genuinely expressive of the temperament of
the people using it; and of the complex American
temper Indian music can never be thus
representative.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar considerations apply to
the British folk-songs which, introduced by
our pioneering grandfathers, have in remote
regions like the Kentucky mountains survived
uncontaminated by modernisms, and have recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
been rediscovered and widely acclaimed.
Here again the piquancy of unfamiliar idiom
and a simplicity that falls agreeably on over-stimulated
ears has aroused an enthusiasm that
overshoots its mark. By all means let us enjoy
these fresh songs, and even embody them in our
music if we find it an interesting experiment.
But can we expect that they will have any far-reaching
interpretative value for us, that they
will express our national temper? That they
are not even native to the soil is a minor objection
to them, for we are importations ourselves.
But that they are, with all their charm,
British through and through, makes it unlikely
that they can adequately reflect a nation
which, though partly British, is also partly
almost everything else.</p>

<p>The case of ragtime is rather more subtle.
Here is a music, local and piquantly idiomatic,
and undeniably representative of a certain
aspect of American character&mdash;our restlessness,
our insatiable nervous activity, our
thoughtless superficial "optimism," our fondness
for "hustling," our carelessness of whither,
how, or why we are moving if only we can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
"keep on the move." If this were all of us,
if the first impression which foreigners get of
us, summed up for them oftentimes in our
inimitably characteristic "Step lively, please,"
were also the last, and there was nothing more
solid, sweet, or wise in America than this galvanic
twitching, then indeed ragtime would
be our perfect music. But every true American
knows that, on the contrary, this is not our
virtue but our vice, not our strength but our
weakness, and that such a picture of us as it
presents is not a portrait but a caricature.
And similarly, as soon as we examine ragtime at
all critically we discover its essential triviality.
Its melodies are commonplace, its harmonies
cheap, shoddy, and sentimental. Even its
rhythm, as we have seen, is a clever formula
rather than a creative form, a trick for giving
ordinary movement a specious air of animation.
It is, in fact, as the writer in the London
Times points out, "a debased imitation of
genuine negro song, just as the popular Gaiety
favorites of the late eighties, 'Enniscorthy'
and 'Ballyhooley,' were debased imitations
of a certain class of Irish folk-song." A few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
lines later this same writer falls into the pitfall
always yawning for the theorist about ragtime,
asks if the American composer will arrive
who can extract gold from this ore, states
coolly that "Ragtime represents the American
nation," and of course ends up with an edifying
reference to an art "really vital because it
has its roots in its own soil." Does he consider
that "Ballyhooley" "represents the Irish
nation"? Would he advise Sir Charles Stanford
to write a symphony upon it? Only an
American journalist could be more naïve, and
here is one that is. "The important point,"
he says, "is that ragtime, whether it be adjudged
good or bad, is original with Americans&mdash;it
is their own creation."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This beggars
comment.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>So far our results are mainly negative. We
have discovered fallacies in several assumptions
too commonly and easily made. We
have set a lower estimate on purely geographical
considerations than is often set. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
tried to distinguish between what in a popular
strain is merely quaint or piquant because of
peculiarities of idiom, and what is more profoundly
true in expression to a national or
racial temper; and while admitting the superficial
charm of such idioms and of the "distinctiveness"
to which they minister, we have
insisted on the far deeper import of interpretative
truth. We have glanced at the
danger of confounding appeal to the majority
with appeal to good taste, which is always
outvoted, or of supposing that "originality"
is of any importance in comparison with merit.
From these criticisms certain positive principles
thus tend to emerge. It becomes evident
that there is a certain gradation of values in
the qualities which a folk-music may possess.
Distinctiveness of idiom is a merit, but a less
vital one than interpretative power; higher
than either is beauty, suitability to enter into
music that may bear comparison with the
best music of the world. Is there any body
of folk-song available to Americans that possesses
any or all of these merits in a higher
degree than the types we have examined?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>We seem to discover such a richer vein in
the songs of the negroes&mdash;not the debased
forms found in ragtime and the "coon-songs"
of the minstrel shows, but the genuine old
plantation tunes, the "spirituals" and "shouts"
of the slaves. In idiomatic individuality, to
begin with, both of harmonic interval and
rhythmic figure, these songs will compare
favorably with those of any European nation.
With many of these they share, indeed, odd
modal intervals of great antiquity, such as the
lowered seventh scale-step in major and the
raised sixth-step in minor. Like Scottish tunes
they make frequent use of the incomplete or
pentatonic scale, omitting the fourth and
seventh steps. A peculiarity in which they
are almost unique is a curious oscillation between
a major key and its relative minor,
especially at cadences, so that one gets a haunting
sense of uncertainty that enhances tenfold
their plaintiveness. In "The Angels Done
Changed My Name" (Figure XXXIV), are
exemplified the lowered seventh step&mdash;at "I
went to pray"&mdash;and the pentatonic scale; in
"You May Bury Me in the East" the raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sixth step&mdash;to the word "trumpet"&mdash;and the
major-minor cadence. The last line begins unmistakably
in E flat, and ends equally unmistakably
in C minor, and gets from that veering
in the wind, so to speak, a peculiar flavor which
we should recognize anywhere as "Negro." It
is noteworthy that both these songs have to
be harmonized strongly and simply with the
staple triads&mdash;it is impossible to harmonize
them otherwise. In other words they are the
product and expression of a primitive but pure
and strong tonal sense, refreshingly free from
the effeminate chromatic harmonies&mdash;the
"barber-shop chords"&mdash;of ragtime. The one
compares with the other as the fervent childish
poetry of the lines here, "Thank God the angels
done changed my name," or "I'll hear the
trumpet sound in that morning" compares
with the slangy doggerel of the cabarets.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

in the third line of "The Angels Done Changed

typical instance of it is "Didn't My Lord
Deliver Daniel" (Figure XXXV), which also
further illustrates major-minor idiom in its
constant see-saw between G minor and B-flat
major. It is pointed out that the slaves had
a strong sense of time, that the overwhelming
majority of their songs are in duple or
march time, with very few in the more graceful
but less vehement triple measure, and that in
their "shouts" or religious dances they rocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
themselves into paroxysms of rhythmic excitement,
one group clapping the meter while
the others sang and scuffled with a "jerking,
twitching motion which agitated the entire
shouter and soon brought out streams of perspiration."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
No doubt the jerk evidences
their love of strong accentuation; but it must
be noted that accentuation is a purely local
thing, affects the meter rather than the rhythm,
and may be assumed and put off by a tune (as
in the "ragging" of a standard melody) without
changing its essential curve.</p>

<p>Far more significant, therefore, than their
half-barbaric fondness for the jerk is the grasp
shown by negroes over the larger and nobler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
reaches of rhythm, their feeling for the phrase
as a whole and ability to impress upon it a
firm and yet varied profile. The second half
of "You May Bury Me in the East," with its
bold festooning of outline, even more strikingly
the tune "Going Up," with its piquant
silences and its even-paced insistence on "going
all the way, Lord," show a unity in their variety,
a certain "all-of-a-piece-ness," compared with
which even "Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel"
seems scrappy, and the ordinary ragtime effusion
pitifully poverty-stricken. There is plenty
of internal evidence, too, that these happy
results are attributable to genuine musical
imagination, and not to luck in the servile
following of felicitous word-patterns. Indeed,
the frequency with which unimportant words
are accented and important ones slurred over
shows that, as is so often the case with great
melodists like Schubert, the words were regarded
more or less as convenient pegs to hang
the melodies on, and the specifically musical
faculty did not easily brook interference. "The
negroes keep exquisite time," writes one of the
editors of "Slave Songs in the United States,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the best of the collections, "and do not suffer
themselves to be daunted by any obstacle in
the words. The most obstinate hymns they
will force to do duty with any tune they please,
and will dash heroically through a trochaic
tune at the head of a column of iambs with
wonderful skill." The sense of independent
tone-pattern, which when possessed by individual
geniuses in supreme degree gives us
the immortal melodies of a Beethoven or a
Brahms, waxes and wanes in these childlike
tunes, sometimes falling back into platitude,
but sometimes advancing to a real distinction
and beauty.</p>

<p>Whether this beauty is of the kind we have
desiderated as the highest quality folk-song
can have, rendering it "suitable to enter into
music that may bear comparison with the best
music of the world," is a further question, and
one which brings us at length to the highly
controversial matter of the kind of treatment
that the composer should give folk-material
in incorporating it into his more finished art.
The variations of taste concerned here are so
subtle that probably unanimity of judgement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
even if it be desirable, will never be attained.
Yet it is certain that treatment of some sort
there must be. The mere collecting, collating,
and setting forth of folk-songs, attractively
arranged for instruments or even orchestrated,
such as we have seen much of from all countries
in recent years, is no more musical art than a
pile of bricks is a building, or a series of anecdotes
literature. So far as it tends to content
the public with such potpourris, the fad for
folk-song is positively injurious to taste, in
something the same way that our modern
floods of petty journalism are injurious to the
capacity for sustained reading. Moreover, even
on their own level such medleys are apt to be
unsatisfactory; for the tunes themselves are
so definite, brief, and complete, and the transitional
passages between them are therefore so
obtrusively transitional, that the net effect
is that of the ill-baked bread pudding from
which we eat nothing but the raisins. Mr.
Coleridge-Taylor's "Twenty-Four Negro Melodies,"
despite incidental attractions, are on
the whole an example of this bad model.</p>

<p>Far worse, however, are those "improvements"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of folk-song which consist in a general
prettifying of its homely simplicity with all
the refinements and luxuries of sophisticated
musical technique&mdash;as if a country maiden
should conceal her healthy color under layers
of rouge. Strange that composers skilful
enough to use them should not recognize the
inappropriateness of Wagnerian chromatics
and Debussyan whole-tone scale harmonies,
to say nothing of all sorts of rich dissonantal
trappings, to tunes as diatonic as "God Save
the King" and as square cut as the "Hymn of
Joy." One would think that the sense of
humor, which revels in incongruity in music
as in other things, would keep them from doing
it and us from taking it so seriously. It would
be invidious to name examples, but they can
be discovered by the discerning; for not even
the negro complexion is proof against this
brand of talcum powder.</p>

<p>The kind of change that is both legitimate
and necessary may perhaps be best suggested
by another example, "Deep River." Here
we have, in the first phrase, that free and firm
molding of rhythmic pattern which is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
so surprising in these songs, so that we might
look far in the best composers without finding
its peer in deliberate, calm beauty. But just
as our hearts are responding to the wave of
emotion thus generated it strikes, so to speak,
a dead wall, falls shattered, and has to begin
over again, without being able to recover the
lost momentum. The imagination is vital as
far as it goes, but its span is short, it lacks sustained
power and cumulative force. What is
needed in the composer who would deal with
such material, then, in addition to a tact that
enters into its spirit, is a synthetic imagination
capable of rounding out its incompleteness,
of tracing the whole of the curve it suggests,
of developing into full life what it presents
only as a germ.</p>

<p>How difficult such a truly creative treatment
is, only those fully know who have tried it;
how rare, musical literature testifies. To add
a measure to a folk-song is almost like adding
a cubit to one's stature, and for the same reason&mdash;that
addition is not what is requisite, but
organic growth. That it is possible we see
in Brahms's masterly treatment of German
student songs in his "Academic Festival Overture";
that it can be applied to negro melodies
we have been shown especially by Dvo&#345;ák.
In his "New World" symphony and his
"American" Quartet and Quintet he assimilated
a peculiar idiom so perfectly that there
is not a note, even in the highly complex harmonies
toward the end of the symphony, that
does not take its place in the scheme unobtrusively.
While the harmonic idiom preponderantly
of simple triads dictated by the
material is maintained with an unerring sense
of style, these commonest of all chords are so
deftly managed that they never become commonplace.
The twin pitfalls of platitude and
sophistication are avoided with equal success.
The same felicity is attained in the construction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
However brief the themes, they do not
sound trivial or unconvincing, because we feel
they have reached their natural growth. Above
all, the same sympathy and power that are
shown in these technical matters so control
the conception as a whole that these works
form a true idealization of negro feeling, in
its moods both of half-barbaric dance and of
naïvely pathetic sentiment.</p>

<p>Dvo&#345;ák's example suffices by itself, then, to
show that the negro music, in the hands of a
master, is capable of two of the three qualities
we demanded of any folk-song&mdash;idiomatic
distinctiveness and capacity for organized
beauty. Does he also demonstrate in it the
third&mdash;adequacy to interpret the American
temper? Something closely kindred to that
temper and easily endeared to it there certainly
is in the restless rhythmic energy, the
unceasing motion and quick changes of these
scherzos, the vigor and dispatch of these allegro
movements. Like similar syncopations and
other rhythmic peculiarities that we find in
those of our composers who have more than
their share of our national nervous energy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
such as Chadwick and Whiting, the negro
rhythms have a crispness and buoyancy that
is somehow appropriate to our clear skies and
self-helpful society. They give at least a far
fairer portrait of us than the caricature of
ragtime. In its more sentimental moods, too,
negro music has an unsophistication, an unreserved
naïveté, that reminds us of similar
traits in the traditional conception of our
fellow countrymen. It thus seems to express
more of our national temperament, and to
leave less of it unexpressed than would on the
whole any other body of folk-song.</p>

<p>Yet the very attempt to formulate these
considerations forces us to realize how hopelessly
inadequate they are as an account of
the possibilities of America in music. The
picture they give of the national type may do
something like justice to it as it existed in
earlier times and simpler surroundings, as it
appears, for instance, in the pages of Mark
Twain or Bret Harte, and as it is symbolised
in the person of Uncle Sam; but the modern
American is a being quite other, far more complex,
far more cosmopolitan, the American not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of nineteenth century New England but of
the twentieth century "melting pot." He is
wholly incommensurate not only with negro
music or any folk music, but with even individual
composers like Dvo&#345;ák in whom
emotion far outruns intellectual subtlety. No
folk music, let us repeat, no individual composer,
no school of composers, can "express"
America. The age of such simplicities is past,
if it ever existed. Whether we like it or not,
we have to take our age and our country as
they are; they are an age of rapidly accelerating
intercommunication of all peoples and a
country in which the internationalism that
thus slowly results is being hastened by actual
admixture on a heretofore unprecedented scale.
Such a condition doubtless has its bad as well
as its good aspects; but if those who bemoan
our "featureless cosmopolitanism" and advocate
an impossible parochialism as the only
remedy would try rather to see how a wider
outlook and a larger sympathy may deepen
our art and make it more truly human by
laying less stress on local, national, or even
racial types, and more on the untrammeled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
expression of the greatest possible variety of
individuals, music would fare better. "National
literature:" wrote Goethe to Eckerman
in 1827, "the term has no longer much
meaning to-day; the time for universal literature
is come, and each ought to work to hasten
its advent." Signs are not wanting that the
condition thus discerned by the wisest men a
century ago is now gradually getting itself
acknowledged in general practice.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>If we accept, in the light of the foregoing
considerations, the ideal of enlightened eclecticism,
not only for our own music here in
America but measurably for all modern music,
since it is all subject to the internationalization
so characteristic of our time, the chief undertaking
that remains to us will be an attempt
to define the position of the American composer
in relation to such eclecticism, the advantages
and disadvantages of his situation,
the pitfalls he must avoid, and the opportunities
he should embrace. From this point of view
it will be seen that the enthusiasts of nationalism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
in advising our composer to confine
himself to Indian, Negro, or ragtime material,
in adjuring him not to listen to the siren voice
of Europe, are not merely misleading but
cheating him. They are asking him to throw
away his birthright of wide cosmopolitan influence
for a mess of purely parochial pottage.
They are bewailing the lack in America of just
those geographical and racial boundary lines
that split up Europe into a series of more or
less petty and hostile camps. They are inviting
us to descend from the point of vantage
good fortune has given us, a little removed
both in space and in time from the thick of the
battle.</p>

<p>For it is indeed the peculiar good fortune of
the young American composer that he finds
spread out before him, as the models through
the study of which he is to acquire an important
part of his technical equipment and of his
general attitude towards art, the masterpieces
of the various European countries, among
which he may pick and choose as his individual
taste directs, and without being hampered
by those annoying racial and national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
jealousies from which the most intelligent
European cannot quite free himself. What
he may acquire of the special virtue of each
school&mdash;the delicacy and distinction of the
French, the solid structural power of the
German, the suave and rich coloring of the
Russian, the austere dignity of the English&mdash;is
limited, not by the accident of birth, but
only by his own assimilative power. No element
in his complex nature need be starved
for want of its proper food. He is placed
in the midst of the stream of world influences
to make of himself what he will and can.</p>

<p>Is it not inconceivable that one thus privileged
to speak, within the measure of his
ability, a world language should ever content
himself with a Negro or Indian dialect? It
would be so perhaps did we not consider that,
in order to speak the world language of cosmopolitan
music as it exists to-day, one must
spend years in laborious discipline and in obscurity,
while any tyro can make a certain
effect and gain a certain prominence by stammering
in an idiom strongly enough tinctured
with local color. Vanity is the immemorial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
enemy of art; if the itch to be conspicuous
once infect him, the artist forgets all those
subtle adaptations, those difficult reconcilements,
which were formerly his passion, and
makes a crude effect that appeals much more
to the primitive minds of the masses. And
this he may do quite unconsciously and in
the sincere belief that he is pursuing the highest
ideals. In the presence of the immediate good,
of recognition and acclaim, it is pitifully easy
to forget the remote better, the broader, finer,
subtler beauty that is not yet understood.</p>

<p>But if the picturesque, the quaint, the
piquant, is by nature more quick to appeal
than the beautiful, it is also more short-lived.
For this reason those writers in all ages and
countries who depend largely on local color
are promptly acclaimed and soon forgotten,
while those who aim at the more universal
human qualities win gradually a place that
proves permanent. Bret Harte was doubtless
considered more "American" by his own
generation than Emerson. Shakespeare is far
less English than Defoe, Dante is not so notably
Italian, or Goethe so notably German, as are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
many lesser men. Or, to come back to music,
where are now the Russian "nationalists"
who excluded Tschaikowsky the "cosmopolite"
from their magic circle? For a while we
listened to their melancholy Russian cadences
with fascinated interest, in spite of their crude
harmonization, their incoherent form, their
lack of instinct for style, because we were
pleased with the novelty. Now the novelty
has worn off, and for human nature's daily
food we find Tschaikowsky, who made the most
of his opportunities, rose above a narrow exclusiveness,
and assimilated power wherever he
found it, far preferable.</p>

<p>The true difficulty of the American composer's
position, then, is to be found, not in the
poverty of the native folk-song, but in the
confusing variety of the foreign influences in
which he is so rich. He has suffered and is
still suffering from an embarrassment of riches,
from a mental indigestion. His cosmopolitanism
is indeed too often "featureless," and
his readiness to be influenced an evidence of
weakness rather than strength, a flat rather
than a broad eclecticism. His technique is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
miscellaneous, his style without distinction,
his art as a whole lacks individuality. This
featurelessness is the typical defect of American
compositions of the present generation,
perhaps&mdash;typical in spite of some notable
exceptions. The technical deficiencies of our
pioneer forefathers are more and more becoming
things of the past; free intercourse
with Europe and the wholesale importation
of skilled European musicians have refined
away the crudities with surprising rapidity;
there are among us to-day musical workmen
whose skill in symphony, chamber music,
and opera will compare favorably with that
of Europeans. Where we still fail is in that
subtle, indefinable, and indispensable touch
of personal distinction which may be recognized
in artists so diverse, both individually
and racially, as Strauss, d'Indy, Debussy,
Rachmaninoff, Paderewski, Sibelius, Elgar.
What is the secret of this distinction?</p>

<p>We may get a clue to the right answer by
considering a peculiar case, an exceptional
case, among ourselves&mdash;the exception that
proves the rule&mdash;the case of MacDowell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
The supreme place he undoubtedly holds
among our composers is due precisely to this
quality of personal distinction, of individuality,
to the fact that his music, in spite of
the pronounced Grieg and Raff elements in
it, does not sound quite like that of any one
else. Technically MacDowell has grave deficiencies;
his harmonic system is singularly
limited, mannered, and monotonous; his
polyphony is weak; his "drawing," as a
painter would say, is often halting and awkward.
His range of expression, moreover,
is not wide, and within it he frequently
cloys by an over-sweet sentimentalism. But
MacDowell is sincere, and he is always himself.
There are no unfused elements in his
style, no outstanding features, that we feel
to have been borrowed and not assimilated.
His style is very narrow, but it is his own.
And the result is that, although we shall soon
forget some of our composers who are far
cleverer than he, we shall not forget MacDowell.</p>

<p>The enemies of eclecticism have thus expressed
a half-truth, we begin to see, when they
call it flabby. Only too easily does it become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
so. As dangerous as it is desirable, it will
contribute to the formation of an artist only
when it is controlled by an instinctive sense of
how much one can assimilate, and the courage
to reject the rest. And here we come to one
of those peculiar difficulties of the position in
which the American composer finds himself.
It is hard for him, recognizing, as his natural
alertness of perception and his detached point
of view enable him to do, the merits of many
different European aims and methods, and,
mainly sensitive as he must be to his own
shortcomings in respect to any of them&mdash;it
is hard for him to distinguish between those
that he can possibly assimilate to his own uses
and those that must remain alien to him;
and it is doubly hard to let the latter alone,
voluntarily restricting his field in order that
he may be the master of it. Yet these selections,
these sacrifices, are at the very foundation
of artistic personality. It is no more possible
for a human being to be, let us say, at once as
subtle as Debussy and as gorgeous as Strauss
than it is to be in two places at once. Which
will you do without? But the young American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
composer is at once too timid and too ambitious
to do without anything; in the attempt
to be everywhere at the same time he cuts
himself up into little pieces that end by being
nowhere.</p>

<p>The frank and courageous acceptance of
limitations is, in truth, the first step toward
artistic individuality; a man can never be an
individual, as the very derivation of the word
may remind him, so long as he remains divided,
spread out very wide and very thin,
unwilling to take sides, but only when he
concentrates himself, is loyal to one cause,
grows out from one nucleus. What this nucleus
shall be, indeed, differs according to
circumstances. For the European musician
it is to some extent decided beforehand, by
the conditions of birth, of national and racial
allegiance. The American, as we said, to begin
with is freer in this respect; but we may
now add that he is no less bound to find a
cause, a unifying center, if he would get beyond
mere clever imitation and become a
genuine person. He must love his cause
so singly that he will cleave to it, and forsake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
all else. Now what is this cause for the American
composer but the utmost musical beauty
that he, as an individual man with his own
qualities and defects, is capable of understanding
and striving towards? And what is the
"all else" that he must forsake, save those
types of musical beauty which, whatever may
be their intrinsic worth, do not come home to
him, do not arouse a sympathetic vibration
in him, leave him cold? He must take sides.
He must be, not a philosopher, but a partisan.
He must have good hearty enthusiasms, and
good hearty prejudices. Only so can he be
an individual.</p>

<p>It matters not one jot, provided this course
of personal loyalty to a cause be steadfastly
pursued, what the special characteristics of
style of the music may be to which one gives
one's devotion. Let A give his life to studying
the delicate color scheme of the French
"ultra-moderns"; let B find his joy in a
polyphony based on Bach's; let C develop
lovingly the cadences or rhythms of Negro
and Indian tunes; all three will be good
musicians, all three good Americans&mdash;for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
after all, American music is only music. The
man who is neither good musician nor good
American is the botcher, the dilettante, the
clever amateur&mdash;he who is too lazy to learn
his business, too pretentious to limit his claims,
too busy talking about art to study it. Such
babblers have always been, and always will
be, naturally, far more numerous than the
efficient workers; and they will doubtless continue
to fill the newspapers and magazines
with their silly superficialities, and do their
utmost to confuse the public into forgetting
that sincerity and skill are the only things that
can ever be justly demanded of an artist.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In demanding skill and sincerity of our
composers, however, we are requiring of them,
as a little analysis will suffice to show, labors
and sacrifices of which only the rarest natures
are capable; and it may well be that the unsatisfactory
character of composition in America
is due far more to the rarity of men able
or willing to undertake such labors and endure
such sacrifices than to the difficulties of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the æsthetic problems we have so far been considering.
Let us, then, in closing, try to suggest
answers to the purely practical questions:
Is there anything about our social and economic
system that lays especial burdens on creative
artists? If there is, is there any hope of correcting
it? Whether it may be corrected or
not, may our composers, through candid recognition
of it, be saved from dissipation of energy
and helped to concentrate their efforts on
objects most likely to be achieved, and most
worth achieving? We shall answer all these
questions affirmatively.</p>

<p>First we must note that the amount and
intensity of mental application involved in
composition is something of which the layman
has little idea. The technique to be mastered
by the composer is singularly difficult; the
tonal material he works in is subtle and intangible;
its relationships, harmonic, rhythmic,
melodic, polyphonic, which he must learn not
only to understand but to manipulate, are of
an indescribable complexity; and he achieves
command of all these fundamental or grammatical
means of his art only to face the far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
subtler distinctions of structure and style on
a wise apprehension of which depends his
artistic individuality. Moreover, if he would
take advantage of the wide and unbiased
view of European music which we have seen
to be a special privilege of the intelligent
American, he must do far more than hear or
read the chief works of many masters; he
must know them in and out, must learn to
breathe the peculiar atmosphere of each,&mdash;must,
in short, live with them. And more
than that, for after analysis comes synthesis,
after assimilation, creation; and as the one
requires laborious, minute, detailed study,
the other requires a wide margin of leisure in
which the mind can forget all these details,
empty itself of all irrelevance, and prepare to
receive whatever thoughts may visit it. Here
is more time needed, in great spaces. This is
a full and varied way of living, indeed, that we
are sketching; and we have not yet made out
how the artist is to live at all. How is he to
get money to support himself?</p>

<p>Not, certainly, from his compositions. They
will do well if they bring him enough to pay for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
ink and paper; they will surely not pay for
their own copying. "A man," says Mr.
Graham Wallas,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> "who gives the best strength
of each day to dreaming about the nature of
God or the State, or the shape of the earth, or
the relation of the sides of a triangle to its
hypotenuse, produces nothing which at the
end of the day he can easily sell. Since the
actual process of inference is unconscious, and
his voluntary control over it indirect and uncertain,
he is not even sure that he will produce
any result at all, whether salable or unsalable,
by months of effort. How then shall he live?"
If this is the situation of the creative thinker
in science, what shall we say of that of the
creative thinker in art? As we have seen in
discussing the relations of democracy and
music, the class which in the eighteenth century
bought the wares of the composer finds its
analogue, under our capitalistic industrial system,
in the frivolous plutocracy, who demand
of music curiosities, novelties, and entertainment.
The vast mass of listeners emerging
from below, on the other hand, of crude and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
childlike taste, prefer stories (program music),
day-dreaming, and sensationalism to beauty.
Confronted by these two classes, the composer
will find his sincerity likely to cost him dear.
If he is really sincere, if he is trying to write
music that presents the kind of beauty that he
hears, and that no one else has heard in just
that way before, he will find himself enjoying
it in a minority of one. Yet the alternative,
to prostitute himself and "give the public
what it wants," is even worse; and when the
public says to him, in the words of Mozart's
publisher, "Write in a more easy, popular
style, or I will not print a note or give you a
kreuzer," his answer can be no other than
Mozart's: "Then, my good sir, I have only
to resign myself and die of hunger."</p>

<p>Or rather, and here is the special irony of
the situation, his alternative is not a literal
physical hunger, but that subtler hunger that
follows the denial of the imperious instinct to
create beauty; he has not to starve his body
of bread, but his soul of music. For while
society withholds with one hand, so to speak,
any payment for the best work he can do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
because it is too good, because it requires too
long to be understood, it freely offers him with
the other a bare livelihood, if not more, for
work of secondary value&mdash;teaching, performance,
exposition, anything but creation. It
constantly pulls, pushes, cajoles, persuades,
coaxes, browbeats him from the superior to
the inferior activity. It so fills his days with
the one that even if at long intervals an opportunity
for the other presents itself he has
hardly the spirit to seize it. It deadens him
with detail, drugs him with drudgery, cages
him until he forgets how to sing. Where, as
in America, there exists a very "high standard
of living," as it is quaintly called, meaning
that many and costly material wants have to
be met before spiritual needs can be considered,
the labor imposed by such a struggle may be
overwhelming. And it is superimposed, we
must remember, on the other labor, the creative
one, described above. The same nerves, body,
and brain, in the same twenty-four hours each
day, must sustain the two labors, one to earn
a livelihood, the other to make use of it. No
wonder few can endure it; no wonder most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
give it up in despair or dull indifference, and
content themselves with the livelihood without
taking the trouble to live.</p>

<p>Not only, moreover, are the broad facts of
economics, under a capitalistic-industrial system,
thus flatly inimical to creative work, but
in a plutocratic civilization like ours the more
subtle forces of public opinion are perhaps
even more fatal to it, because more pervasive
and intangible. In Europe the impecunious
artist is accepted with tolerance, even with a
touch of respect, and suffered to live undisturbed
in his Bohemia and to pursue his dreams.
To us, who still as a people recognize no measure
of achievement but income, and who accept
without a murmur the domination of mass-convention
in most matters of opinion, he is
something worse than an interesting eccentric
or even a harmless crank; he is something
of a sybarite and a skulker; he is one who
"doesn't play the game." Therefore he need
look to us for understanding or sympathy no
more than for more material rewards. If he
wishes to be approved of, let him do something
useful&mdash;that is, something that pays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>When we realize the penalties that are thus
piled upon the head of the artist whose only
offense is that he wishes to give something to
society of which it does not yet recognize the
value, our wonder that there is so little American
composition of the first quality changes
to surprise that there is any. We begin to
suspect&mdash;as Ruskin did at forty, and devoted
the rest of his life to demonstrating the truth
of his suspicion&mdash;that the decadence of art
we witness all around us is only a symptom of
a deeper disease, and that, as William Morris
expressed it, "Slavery lies between us and
art."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Capitalistic industrialism, as Matthew
Arnold saw, "materializes our upper class,
vulgarizes our middle class, brutalizes our
lower class"; and under such conditions vital
art can have no secure or assured life. It
may well be, therefore, that art can only in the
long run be saved, like society itself, by the
fairer, freer, humaner system that socialism
promises. It cannot but thrill all true lovers
of art to find its claims, with those of a liberalized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
society, being championed to-day, no
longer merely by individual thinkers like
Ruskin and Morris, but by great representative
bodies like the British Labor Party.
"Society, like the individual," says a draft
report of this party<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> "does not live by bread
alone&mdash;does not exist only for perpetual
wealth production. The Labour Party will
insist on greatly increased public provision
being made for scientific investigation and
original research, in every branch of knowledge,
not to say also for the promotion of music,
literature, and fine art, which have been under
capitalism so greatly neglected, and upon
which, so the Labour Party holds, any real
development of civilization fundamentally depends."</p>

<p>Finally, however, inspiring as are the hopes
these words suggest, the American composer
need not await their realization before putting
forth those individual efforts without the aid
of which, after all, they can never attain it.
Music, like society, has reached its present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
state only through the struggles, against immense
odds, of its martyrs and its heroes: not
only of Bach, of Mozart, of Beethoven, of
Schubert, of Wagner, of Brahms, but of countless
others who have wrought and suffered in
obscurity and with a consecration of their more
limited powers to the great cause of beauty.
And if American life lays almost crushing
burdens on artistic initiative, there is also in
the best American tradition a courage, an independence,
a certain nonchalant and plucky
self-reliance that ought to carry an artist far
on the solitary path he has to travel. It
ought to keep him from turning back, though
it could not guard him against wandering and
getting lost. All that can help him there is
clearsightedness, a realistic and unsentimental
view of the society in which he lives and the
terms on which he lives in it. He must discharge
the work he does for a livelihood as
conscientiously as he can, but meanwhile not
forget to live also. He must not make the
tragic mistake, the unpardonable sin of the
artist, described by Thoreau: "To please our
friends and relatives we turn out our silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ore in cartloads, while we neglect to work
our mines of gold known only to ourselves,
far up in the Sierras, where we pulled up a
bush in our mountain walk, and saw the
glittering treasure. Let us return thither.
Let it be the price of our freedom to make that
known." He must cut down his material
requirements to the minimum and honor his
own poverty. He must learn to find his
satisfaction in the work itself, and not expect
recognition, which is bound to be late (even
later in America than elsewhere), and likely
to be mistaken. Above all, he must not pity
himself or grow embittered, for in the possession
of a lifelong enthusiasm, an ideal
that he can always work towards and will
never reach, he has the best gift that life has
to offer.</p>

Strauss, Puccini, etc.</p>

<p>He has written not for the musically learned, but for all those
who enjoy music and wish to listen intelligently to the opera. Of
each of the works considered, he gives the plot, something of the
origin, interesting historical anecdotes of the conception and presentation,
and much information of an untechnical sort about the
characteristics of the music.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
